 Hello. So we should discuss a topic, right? Yeah, I think it's just a randomly pick up

1
0:00:29.210000-->0:00:36.830000
 two person to make a pair to discuss the topic set there. What is a challenge of

2
0:00:36.830000-->0:00:50.600000
 the cognitive science in future? So, oh yeah, it's just a free brainstorm about

3
0:00:50.600000-->0:00:55.840000
 how we think about the future of the cognitive science. Do they have some, I

4
0:00:55.840000-->0:01:05.420000
 mean, challenge problem that we need to deal with or yeah. I know it's kind of

5
0:01:05.420000-->0:01:25.710000
 awkward that have such experiment online here like this, right? Me too. So we still, I

6
0:01:25.710000-->0:01:31.910000
 mean, it looks like we cannot skip this step, right? Just wait here until the

7
0:01:32.210000-->0:01:52.380000
 time, I mean, Pablo set there. Yeah, or maybe your idea about the future of the

8
0:01:52.380000-->0:02:01.350000
 cognitive science. Which direction should we, I mean, go to

9
0:02:01.350000-->0:02:40.510000
 or your interest, I think. I mean, new technique for brain imaging. Yeah, so when

10
0:02:40.510000-->0:02:47.090000
 you mentioned about the method, do you mean like the technique

11
0:02:47.090000-->0:02:54.650000
 that is kind of brain in terms of the spatial temporal resolution or you mean

12
0:02:54.650000-->0:03:00.390000
 the method that's how we analyze the data to get into more questions or

13
0:03:00.390000-->0:03:40.330000
 phenomenons that we can explore? Which do you mean? Yeah, I think I have

14
0:03:40.330000-->0:03:45.830000
 similar feeling like you but from a kind of different perspective that maybe we

15
0:03:45.830000-->0:03:55.530000
 can find a way of perspective that we can link conceptually the algorithm

16
0:03:55.530000-->0:04:05.650000
 between the brain and in, you know, deep models because I think each of them can

17
0:04:05.650000-->0:04:09.910000
 give some inspirations about how to go further than the
