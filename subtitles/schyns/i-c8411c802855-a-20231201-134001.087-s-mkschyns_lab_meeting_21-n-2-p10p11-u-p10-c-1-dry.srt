0
0:00:11.400000-->0:00:21.970000
 Yes, we are supposed to discuss the future of face research.

1
0:00:22.530000-->0:00:24.790000
 What should we do in the future of face research?

2
0:00:24.850000-->0:00:30.050000
 I think that Pablo is looking for good questions for experiments.

3
0:00:30.170000-->0:00:39.640000
 Yeah, me too.

4
0:00:41.240000-->0:00:42.720000
 I can see on your face.

5
0:00:42.960000-->0:00:43.940000
 It's quite clear.

6
0:00:44.360000-->0:00:46.800000
 Can you try to maintain a neutral face?

7
0:00:56.730000-->0:00:58.130000
 It's difficult to...

8
0:00:58.130000-->0:01:00.470000
 Oh, yes, I see you going down now.

9
0:01:01.010000-->0:01:03.050000
 I think it's going into the negative.

10
0:01:09.640000-->0:01:10.160000
 Yeah, that's right.

11
0:01:21.370000-->0:01:25.670000
 Yeah, here we are figuring out the tricks of manipulating the mouth down.

12
0:01:25.990000-->0:01:27.370000
 That's what he's doing here.

13
0:01:27.510000-->0:01:29.570000
 Yeah, you just went down.

14
0:01:41.520000-->0:01:44.600000
 But sometimes the down goes, bing, bing, like this.

15
0:01:45.480000-->0:01:48.940000
 When you really push down, you see two quick down, down.

16
0:01:59.210000-->0:01:59.530000
 Right.

17
0:01:59.570000-->0:02:00.490000
 You just did it.

18
0:02:03.020000-->0:02:03.040000
 Yeah.

19
0:02:03.040000-->0:02:03.160000
 Yeah.

20
0:02:04.740000-->0:02:05
 Yeah.

21
0:02:07.840000-->0:02:07.960000
 Yeah.

22
0:02:07.960000-->0:02:08.100000
 Yeah.

23
0:02:10.060000-->0:02:10.080000
 Yeah.

24
0:02:10.080000-->0:02:10.480000
 I wonder the extent to which he can...

25
0:02:11.060000-->0:02:13.300000
 He probably doesn't do that readout.

26
0:02:13.400000-->0:02:15.320000
 When is the best time to do it?

27
0:02:15.800000-->0:02:20.260000
 To amplify something you already do or, you know, or whether it's...

28
0:02:20.260000-->0:02:22.460000
 I think it's random here, from what I understand.

29
0:02:25.630000-->0:02:25.870000
 Yeah.

30
0:02:26.010000-->0:02:26.530000
 Yeah.

31
0:02:30.710000-->0:02:31.250000
 Yeah.

32
0:02:35.270000-->0:02:35.290000
 Yeah.

33
0:02:35.290000-->0:02:37.590000
 And sometimes this deformation gives a very bizarre expression.

34
0:02:38.500000-->0:02:43.120000
 You just had a very bizarre expression there because it just deformed you in a strange

35
0:02:44.240000-->0:02:44.260000
 way.

36
0:02:44.260000-->0:02:44.480000
 Yeah.

37
0:02:46.980000-->0:02:47
 Yeah.

38
0:02:47-->0:02:51.740000
 But it's still quite cool that he can do this even if we rotate our faces or move them about.

39
0:02:52.600000-->0:02:52.820000
 Yeah.

40
0:02:52.820000-->0:02:52.960000
 Yeah.

41
0:02:55.500000-->0:02:55.520000
 Yeah.

42
0:02:56.500000-->0:02:56.520000
 Yeah.

43
0:02:57.650000-->0:02:58.090000
 Because it's tracking where we are, right?

44
0:02:59.010000-->0:02:59.070000
 To do it.

45
0:02:59.550000-->0:03:00.230000
 But it's tracked.

46
0:03:00.230000-->0:03:00.950000
 Yeah.

47
0:03:04.380000-->0:03:04.400000
 Yeah.

48
0:03:04.400000-->0:03:04.680000
 Yeah.

49
0:03:06.370000-->0:03:06.690000
 Yeah.

50
0:03:06.690000-->0:03:06.830000
 Yeah.

51
0:03:07.230000-->0:03:07.450000
 Yeah.

52
0:03:10.210000-->0:03:10.230000
 Yeah.

53
0:03:11.210000-->0:03:11.230000
 Yeah.

54
0:03:11.230000-->0:03:12.630000
 It'd be interesting if one of us was to rotate on their seat so we'd see the back of our

55
0:03:12.630000-->0:03:15.490000
 head and you'd see little smiles in the air.

56
0:03:15.490000-->0:03:15.510000
 Yeah.

57
0:03:16.230000-->0:03:16.650000
 Yeah.

58
0:03:31.360000-->0:03:31.380000
 Yeah.

59
0:03:31.380000-->0:03:39.580000
 Or what you could do is turn around and put a drawn face on the back of your head.

60
0:03:51.510000-->0:03:55.230000
 That's what we should do is draw a face instead of...

61
0:03:55.230000-->0:03:56.910000
 So what happens if I do this?

62
0:03:56.930000-->0:03:59.070000
 Do you see any movement?

63
0:04:00.370000-->0:04:00.570000
 No.

64
0:04:01.790000-->0:04:01.950000
 No.

65
0:04:07.410000-->0:04:07.590000
 Yeah.

66
0:04:07.590000-->0:04:07.770000
 Yeah.

67
0:04:08.630000-->0:04:08.650000
 Yeah.

68
0:04:08.650000-->0:04:08.660000
 Yeah.

69
0:04:08.670000-->0:04:08.690000
 Yeah.

70
0:04:08.690000-->0:04:08.710000
 Yeah.

71
0:04:08.710000-->0:04:08.730000
 Yeah.

72
0:04:08.730000-->0:04:08.750000
 Yeah.

73
0:04:08.750000-->0:04:08.770000
 Yeah.

74
0:04:08.770000-->0:04:08.790000
 Yeah.

75
0:04:08.790000-->0:04:08.810000
 Yeah.

76
0:04:08.810000-->0:04:08.830000
 Yeah.

77
0:04:08.830000-->0:04:08.850000
 Yeah.

78
0:04:08.850000-->0:04:08.870000
 Yeah.
