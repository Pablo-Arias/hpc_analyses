 Hello. Are you also typing a lot? I also have another chat going on at the side.

1
0:00:28.850000-->0:00:33.690000
 No, I think we should wait for this. I think we have another four-minute chat and then we'll go

2
0:00:33.690000-->0:00:40.330000
 back. So this one we're supposed to talk about phase research. So my last one was Pablo.

3
0:00:41.510000-->0:00:48.350000
 So he was busy doing the programming and now it's this one. We're supposed to talk about the future

4
0:00:48.350000-->0:01:05.240000
 of phase research, I think. Yeah, well, you have a lot to say about it. The AUs. Yeah.

5
0:01:32.170000-->0:01:41.470000
 Oh, great. Yeah. No, it's great. I think if we get something reliable,

6
0:01:41.630000-->0:01:47.470000
 you know, with AUs, MEG, and yeah, I think Start Simple is always good. That's really exciting.

7
0:01:47.470000-->0:02:46.760000
 Yeah. Lots going on. Yeah, I missed the talk of Pablo when they presented that experiment,

8
0:02:47.780000-->0:02:53.080000
 but I think they're going to tell me about the experiment at some point. I think we have a

9
0:02:53.080000-->0:03:02.910000
 meeting for next week. So yeah, I think then it would be good to discuss the MEG. Is there

10
0:03:02.910000-->0:03:06.290000
 something going on in the background? Is there some cooking or something, or is it part of the

11
0:03:06.290000-->0:03:12.960000
 system of Pablo? Yeah. Oh, that's okay. No, I just wanted to check because he asked for feedback

12
0:03:12.960000-->0:03:17.380000
 on the, you know, Pablo asked for feedback on the sound and stuff and how it works. So

13
0:03:22.860000-->0:03:26.720000
 yeah, I think they might be doing stuff to manipulate our faces. You know, that's the

14
0:03:26.720000-->0:03:29.720000
 whole point of it, right? So I'm trying to see if your face looks normal or

15
0:03:30.340000-->0:03:36.460000
 we have to wait to see what he's been doing to us. No, I told him, yeah, to me it looks normal,

16
0:03:36.460000-->0:03:40.140000
 but I don't know, you know, like it's, yeah, I don't know. I think he might be

17
0:03:40.140000-->0:03:45.280000
 betrayed because he just does this smile. He just manipulates a little bit the smile.

18
0:03:47.790000-->0:03:51.880000
 Yeah. It's also funny not seeing myself. You know, normally when we have the Zoom,

19
0:03:51.980000-->0:04:00.250000
 you see the camera of yourself. And so I think, okay, so we have 15 seconds and then we go back.

20
0:04:02.380000-->0:04:09.360000
 Yeah. Bye. Well, I guess we have to wait for the timer.
