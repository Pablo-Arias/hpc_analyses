 Hey Robin, oh great great, how are you? Can you hear me correctly?

1
0:00:29.900000-->0:00:35.830000
 What were the instructions this time? Sorry I didn't have the time to read it because I was looking at other things.

2
0:00:35.830000-->0:00:44.830000
 Okay, cognitive science thing.

3
0:00:44.830000-->0:00:55.930000
 They didn't read it, I think. So we should all be interacting at the moment, I'm just checking that all these things are working.

4
0:00:55.930000-->0:00:58.870000
 Yeah, good, this is good.

5
0:01:05.770000-->0:01:08.610000
 I could continue too quickly now.

6
0:01:13.580000-->0:01:17.590000
 No, but it won't let him join anyways.

7
0:01:23.050000-->0:01:31.400000
 So it was cognitive science, right? Yeah, good.

8
0:01:32.240000-->0:01:36.070000
 How's the quality? Do you see good quality on my end?

9
0:01:45.220000-->0:01:47.210000
 Okay, good.

10
0:01:47.310000-->0:01:49.230000
 Okay, so people are advancing.

11
0:01:50.760000-->0:01:53.540000
 I can see everything that's happening quite.

12
0:01:53.760000-->0:02:04.260000
 And I had to change things just before because we were 14 and 14 divided by 2 is 7 so we can't have groups of 7.

13
0:02:04.760000-->0:02:11.340000
 So I was like oh no, so I had to change the code, deploy it to the server while Carlos is talking.

14
0:02:11.760000-->0:02:16.140000
 And I didn't manage to do it actually. Somehow it broke.

15
0:02:16.760000-->0:02:17.440000
 But anyway.

16
0:02:18.760000-->0:02:26.820000
 Yeah, so this last 4 minutes and basically everyone is interacting at the moment in pairs and they are all brainstorming.

17
0:02:28.760000-->0:02:42.510000
 And we are recording all the videos from every participant to the servers and that's what I'm going to show after if I get some time.

18
0:02:42.510000-->0:02:43.630000
 This won't last too much.

19
0:02:45.230000-->0:02:57.450000
 At the moment for this experiment, well I can't say but it's mostly a control.

20
0:02:59.230000-->0:03:02.210000
 I mean you would say it right if it was.

21
0:03:06.850000-->0:03:10.150000
 No, no, I wouldn't do that.

22
0:03:27.370000-->0:03:27.610000
 Yeah.

23
0:03:27.630000-->0:03:29.660000
 Yeah, that's true.

24
0:03:35.350000-->0:03:35.490000
 Yeah.

25
0:03:37.190000-->0:03:43.550000
 So I'll just say sorry for the ones that didn't make it.

26
0:03:43.550000-->0:03:47.010000
 We will be with you shortly.

27
0:03:47.010000-->0:04:03.110000
 Yeah, so conversation is going to be over.

28
0:04:03.110000-->0:04:05.790000
 So we're going to move to the next stage.
