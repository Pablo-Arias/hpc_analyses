 Hey, what's your name? Oh, very nice. Congrats. See, so it's already evening in your in your place. Okay

1
0:00:55.470000-->0:01:04.170000
 Sure, I mean, I'm really not any expert in this I don't know anything about face research besides the superficial

2
0:01:04.170000-->0:01:08.970000
 So I think maybe you can start and I just add some thoughts or questions maybe

3
0:01:09.430000-->0:01:22.630000
 And so my research topic is more in a visual cognition so an

4
0:01:22.630000-->0:01:26.430000
 between cognition and visual perception and I'm mainly

5
0:01:26.430000-->0:01:32.050000
 Interested in objects seeing objects in a dynamic world and trying to build like brain computational

6
0:01:32.050000-->0:01:38.310000
 That means neural network models of these processes that perform like almost real-world

7
0:01:38.310000-->0:01:42.270000
 Tasks in a way that humans also do like mostly computation modeling

8
0:01:42.330000-->0:01:48.490000
 So, I guess humans also a face also objects but not the kinds of objects I'm looking at primarily

9
0:04:01.450000-->0:04:06.370000
 No worries interesting, yeah
