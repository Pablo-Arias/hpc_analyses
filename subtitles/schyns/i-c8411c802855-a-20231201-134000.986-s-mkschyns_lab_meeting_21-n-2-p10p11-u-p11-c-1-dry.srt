0:00:02.640000-->0:00:15.770000
 Sorry, I didn't see the text.

1
0:00:15.770000-->0:00:17.090000
 Did you know the question?

2
0:00:17.090000-->0:00:23.960000
 I was a face reason.

3
0:00:25.650000-->0:00:26.210000
 Okay.

4
0:00:31.250000-->0:00:32.990000
 Oh, okay.

5
0:00:33.150000-->0:00:37.950000
 Yeah. I can see the manipulation of your smile already.

6
0:00:38.370000-->0:01:05.700000
 No. Oh, I didn't see him.

7
0:01:05.720000-->0:01:10.870000
 Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see, I see.

8
0:01:10.990000-->0:01:13.510000
 Yeah, I see on your face as well.

9
0:01:14.550000-->0:01:17.430000
 We are not good participants.

10
0:01:17.430000-->0:01:20.890000
 We are now trying to figure out all the tricks.

11
0:01:26.350000-->0:01:32.450000
 Yeah. I think some amplitude works.

12
0:01:32.450000-->0:01:34.510000
 So I think that in the previous session,

13
0:01:34.510000-->0:01:39.110000
 he was basically doing the up and this one is like down.

14
0:01:39.110000-->0:01:46.760000
 Yeah. Oh, you mean very quick.

15
0:01:50.510000-->0:01:55.950000
 I feel like when we're talking,

16
0:01:55.950000-->0:01:57.050000
 it's difficult to see, right?

17
0:01:57.050000-->0:01:59.650000
 Because you're already moving the mouse corner a little bit.

18
0:02:01.310000-->0:02:04.170000
 I didn't do anything yet.

19
0:02:04.170000-->0:02:06.510000
 The algorithm helped me did.

20
0:02:06.510000-->0:02:07.290000
 Yeah. Yeah.

21
0:02:15.280000-->0:02:16.650000
 Yeah.

22
0:02:16.650000-->0:02:23.640000
 That's a, of course,

23
0:02:23.640000-->0:02:25.280000
 I think that's just a test out there, right?

24
0:02:25.280000-->0:02:26.540000
 And you have to, I mean,

25
0:02:26.540000-->0:02:28.160000
 make it like when will be

26
0:02:28.160000-->0:02:30.520000
 a very complicated question to figure out because you

27
0:02:30.520000-->0:02:33.360000
 have to first see what the face is doing.

28
0:02:36.050000-->0:02:36.070000
 Yeah.

29
0:02:44.390000-->0:02:45.270000
 Oh, yeah.

30
0:02:51.930000-->0:02:52.150000
 Oh, okay.

31
0:02:52.150000-->0:02:56.700000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see.

32
0:03:01.880000-->0:03:02.960000
 Yeah. Because of the landmark,

33
0:03:02.960000-->0:03:05.820000
 I think it's like attached to your face quite well.

34
0:03:18.050000-->0:03:21.170000
 So yeah, but what I know,

35
0:03:21.170000-->0:03:24.410000
 I don't think it will do it because we'll like if I write the program,

36
0:03:24.410000-->0:03:27.050000
 I will first and the landmark to the face.

37
0:03:27.050000-->0:03:28.330000
 If I didn't detect a face,

38
0:03:28.330000-->0:03:30.350000
 then I will not manipulate it, right?

39
0:03:30.350000-->0:03:31.930000
 That's my assumption.

40
0:03:39.310000-->0:03:39.690000
 Yeah.

41
0:03:40.470000-->0:03:46.310000
 I think if we put like a drawer lines here,

42
0:03:46.310000-->0:03:49.630000
 as long as it looks like a face and we'll start to look at

43
0:03:49.630000-->0:03:51.570000
 this corner of mouse moving.

44
0:03:51.570000-->0:03:59.550000
 So yeah. I didn't see it.

45
0:03:59.970000-->0:04:01.290000
 I didn't see any change.

46
0:04:01.790000-->0:04:04.030000
 Yeah. We should check to Pablo.

47
0:04:04.030000-->0:04:06.850000
 Maybe next time that just put an image here,

48
0:04:06.850000-->0:04:09.770000
 then I'm pretty sure it will also change the face.
