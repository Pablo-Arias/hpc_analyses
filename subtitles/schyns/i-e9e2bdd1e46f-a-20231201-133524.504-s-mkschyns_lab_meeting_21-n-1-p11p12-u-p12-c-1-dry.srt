0
0:00:19.020000-->0:00:20.120000
 Am I mute?

1
0:00:23.680000-->0:00:25.860000
 But I can't see others.

2
0:00:25.860000-->0:00:26.780000
 I can only see you.

3
0:00:26.780000-->0:00:27.200000
 Is that?

4
0:00:31.380000-->0:00:32.080000
 Ah, yeah.

5
0:00:32.700000-->0:00:37.600000
 Any idea what the challenge I had in the?

6
0:00:38.200000-->0:00:38.460000
 Oh.

7
0:00:42.770000-->0:00:45.390000
 Are we supposed to talk about the?

8
0:00:46.400000-->0:00:46.920000
 Oh.

9
0:00:48.580000-->0:00:49.720000
 Did you see?

10
0:00:50.480000-->0:00:51.340000
 Did you see that?

11
0:01:01.030000-->0:01:09.170000
 Uh, I, I, oh, OK.

12
0:01:09.990000-->0:01:10.650000
 Yeah.

13
0:01:10.710000-->0:01:13.690000
 The task is like we need to talk about the.

14
0:01:18.600000-->0:01:21.160000
 I definitely, I think I definitely

15
0:01:21.160000-->0:01:24.560000
 see some change over here.

16
0:01:33.960000-->0:01:34.460000
 Why?

17
0:01:43.810000-->0:01:44.370000
 Yeah, yeah.

18
0:01:44.970000-->0:01:49.150000
 So what do you think about like the cognitive science

19
0:01:49.170000-->0:01:50.190000
 challenging?

20
0:02:08.150000-->0:02:12.470000
 Yeah, I actually do not have such big picture of that.

21
0:02:22.310000-->0:02:24.530000
 Yeah, because I'm doing confidence.

22
0:02:24.530000-->0:02:26.990000
 So I think, I feel like one direction

23
0:02:26.990000-->0:02:30.270000
 is that they are going to build much more complicated models.

24
0:02:31.230000-->0:02:37.550000
 Consider both evidence and also like tendency of one's choice.

25
0:02:38.310000-->0:02:41.390000
 I think for now, the model they all build

26
0:02:41.390000-->0:02:43.670000
 are kind of unreliable.

27
0:02:44.370000-->0:02:47.210000
 At least from the data I tested, they

28
0:02:47.210000-->0:02:49.010000
 do not show very good reliability.

29
0:02:49.010000-->0:02:53.330000
 So I feel there must be some, like because full perception

30
0:02:53.910000-->0:03:00.870000
 as what you do, like you have really well-defined space

31
0:03:00.870000-->0:03:01.970000
 of stimuli.

32
0:03:01.970000-->0:03:05.590000
 And like the data you collected can well fit it,

33
0:03:05.790000-->0:03:10.010000
 like use that space to have a really good prediction,

34
0:03:10.010000-->0:03:13.270000
 things like that, which is not the case for Covenant,

35
0:03:13.270000-->0:03:13.770000
 I think.

36
0:03:16.210000-->0:03:24.980000
 No, I think it's because the cognitive process is not

37
0:03:24.980000-->0:03:25.780000
 well-defined.

38
0:03:25.780000-->0:03:28.200000
 It's quite complicated.

39
0:03:28.200000-->0:03:32.580000
 It contains both perception part and also like the more higher

40
0:03:32.580000-->0:03:33.300000
 order things.

41
0:03:33.300000-->0:03:37.660000
 So it's quite difficult to have a really well, yeah.

42
0:03:37.820000-->0:03:54.770000
 So I have no idea, but I feel like it's

43
0:03:54.770000-->0:04:00.630000
 requires some modeling thing, like math thing,

44
0:04:00.630000-->0:04:02.110000
 which I'm not good at.

45
0:04:02.110000-->0:04:03.890000
 But I feel like that's the key.
