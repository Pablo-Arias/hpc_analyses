 Hey, how's it going?

1
0:00:16.990000-->0:00:17.350000
 Good, good.

2
0:00:17.350000-->0:00:20.690000
 So we are supposed to talk about the future of face research.

3
0:00:24.880000-->0:00:25.460000
 Yeah.

4
0:00:29.100000-->0:00:32.410000
 So I think that...

5
0:00:32.410000-->0:00:32.950000
 Right, right.

6
0:00:32.950000-->0:00:41.470000
 So I guess what I'm doing right now is like in our lab, a lot of the work has been on emotions, right?

7
0:00:41.470000-->0:00:47.030000
 Like, so facial expression of happy, sad, surprised and so on.

8
0:00:47.030000-->0:01:02.270000
 And I'm trying to extend it a bit into pragmatics, which is like how we use facial expressions in conversations to express, for example, how confident or how certain we are about specific things.

9
0:01:05.230000-->0:01:05.250000
 And...

10
0:01:05.250000-->0:01:06.030000
 And...

11
0:01:06.610000-->0:01:11.930000
 Sorry, Chawna is talking very loudly behind me, so I sometimes can't hear myself.

12
0:01:13.690000-->0:01:22.710000
 And basically what I'm trying to do is to figure out how language and facial expressions combine.

13
0:01:22.710000-->0:01:32.090000
 So like if you, when you say something and you change the way that your face moves while you say this, how the person will interpret it differently.

14
0:01:32.090000-->0:01:46.410000
 So for example, if I say like, yes or yes, you know, and there's also voice features, how these two modalities interact and also how like the speech can be differently interpreted.

15
0:01:46.410000-->0:01:53.250000
 Like it's the same words, but just because you have like a facial expression, you get a different interpretation from it.

16
0:01:54.690000-->0:02:09.110000
 Another thing I'm doing with Pablo now is a study where we, I think maybe you saw the presentation, right? The really study, like where we want to look at the word really, like whether it's a question or like really or really like a statement.

17
0:02:09.110000-->0:02:18.310000
 And there we try to do reverse correlation with both the face features and the voice features and see how the two modalities kind of interact.

18
0:02:19.850000-->0:02:20.530000
 Does that make sense?

19
0:02:43.690000-->0:02:57.870000
 Yeah. Yeah. And they can be also aligned or misaligned. Right. So, yeah. Or you can make it longer. You can make both longer or one shorter and so on. There's like a lot of dynamics that you can kind of control.

20
0:03:14.550000-->0:03:29.150000
 Yes. Yeah. So with Yearning, we also want to do it in MEG. So Pablo and I will do first behavioral study and then Yearning can turn it into an MEG experiment.

21
0:03:32.620000-->0:03:49.880000
 But we're going to start quite simple. Like our first experiment is going to be very simple because, as you say, it's very complicated. So we just start with some features. And then, for example, the length and like temporal, we will do later, I think. Just need to start simple and see how to even analyze the data and so on.

22
0:03:49.880000-->0:04:09.900000
 For now, the first pilot and then we put it into MEG. Yeah. But we want to, if we can get some results, we will put it into MEG. Sorry, I think that's it.
