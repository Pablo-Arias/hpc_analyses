0
0:00:13.480000-->0:00:14.120000
 Can you hear me?

1
0:00:16.390000-->0:00:17.730000
 I can't hear you.

2
0:00:18.730000-->0:00:20.470000
 Oh, I'm muted. How am I muted?

3
0:00:22.120000-->0:00:23.300000
 No, that's Zoom telling me

4
0:00:23.300000-->0:00:23.660000
 I'm muted.

5
0:00:29.510000-->0:00:34.340000
 I guess maybe

6
0:00:34.340000-->0:00:35.840000
 Zoom is taking still...

7
0:00:37.140000-->0:00:38.440000
 I'm just gonna change

8
0:00:38.440000-->0:00:39.640000
 the device from Zoom.

9
0:00:50.090000-->0:00:50.650000
 How about now?

10
0:00:54.270000-->0:00:55.830000
 I'm just gonna leave Zoom for a second.

11
0:00:55.830000-->0:00:57.470000
 Maybe they're taking my camera

12
0:00:57.470000-->0:01:00.870000
 and my mic. Ah, now I can hear you, yeah.

13
0:01:02.360000-->0:01:02.920000
 Can you hear me?

14
0:01:03.820000-->0:01:04.060000
 Yeah.

15
0:01:07.540000-->0:01:07.900000
 Yeah.

16
0:01:08.560000-->0:01:10.200000
 Sorry, what was your name?

17
0:01:12.830000-->0:01:13.650000
 Yasson.

18
0:01:17.200000-->0:01:18.550000
 Okay, nice to meet you.

19
0:01:18.710000-->0:01:29.770000
 Mhm.

20
0:01:32.890000-->0:01:34.870000
 What do you think? You wanna start?

21
0:01:51.190000-->0:01:52.270000
 Yeah, so

22
0:01:52.270000-->0:01:54.550000
 I guess maybe one start

23
0:01:54.550000-->0:01:55.430000
 is to think about

24
0:01:56.170000-->0:01:58.950000
 what the future brings in any way.

25
0:01:58.950000-->0:02:00.750000
 So I think one of the hot topics

26
0:02:00.750000-->0:02:02.390000
 right now is AI development, right?

27
0:02:02.390000-->0:02:04.210000
 That seems like one of the

28
0:02:04.230000-->0:02:06.650000
 big things that is going to

29
0:02:06.650000-->0:02:08.370000
 transform our lives and how we think about

30
0:02:08.370000-->0:02:10.410000
 people and interactions.

31
0:02:10.410000-->0:02:12.890000
 And so

32
0:02:12.890000-->0:02:14.710000
 I guess cognitive science will be

33
0:02:14.710000-->0:02:15.610000
 involved a lot.

34
0:02:16.590000-->0:02:19.890000
 So the question would

35
0:02:19.890000-->0:02:21.970000
 be what does that mean

36
0:02:21.970000-->0:02:22.830000
 for cognitive science?

37
0:02:23.310000-->0:03:19.950000
 Mhm.

38
0:03:29.900000-->0:03:32.160000
 Yeah, that's a good point. I think that's

39
0:03:32.160000-->0:03:34.240000
 probably one of the big

40
0:03:34.240000-->0:03:36.460000
 contributions to bring cognitive science

41
0:03:36.460000-->0:03:38.400000
 to the table to understanding

42
0:03:38.400000-->0:03:39.500000
 these complex systems.

43
0:03:40.360000-->0:03:41.960000
 But I think another point you said,

44
0:03:41.960000-->0:03:44.240000
 I think it's also actually important to acknowledge

45
0:03:44.240000-->0:03:46.480000
 that purely understanding

46
0:03:46.480000-->0:03:48.320000
 a system doesn't mean you know how

47
0:03:48.320000-->0:03:49.340000
 to build it, basically.

48
0:03:49.880000-->0:03:52.080000
 Like a lot of these systems right now,

49
0:03:52.080000-->0:03:54.200000
 they are conceived

50
0:03:54.200000-->0:03:55.580000
 in a way

51
0:03:56.020000-->0:03:58.200000
 basically void of any

52
0:03:58.200000-->0:03:59.160000
 cognitive understanding.

53
0:04:04.290000-->0:04:05.250000
 But yeah, so okay.

54
0:04:05.330000-->0:04:06.430000
 Nice to meet you.
