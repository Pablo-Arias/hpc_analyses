0:00:12.200000-->0:00:16.210000
 Hello, I'm doing okay, and you?

1
0:00:22.290000-->0:00:25.050000
 That's what I was thinking with the last one.

2
0:00:27.250000-->0:00:36
 Yeah, I think so.

3
0:00:41.670000-->0:00:44.090000
 I'm not really sure, to be honest.

4
0:00:44.670000-->0:00:48.870000
 With the previous one, I was a little bit stuck as well, about what to talk about.

5
0:00:56.460000-->0:00:57.740000
 True.

6
0:01:03.160000-->0:01:03.460000
 Yeah.

7
0:01:03.460000-->0:01:04.560000
 Yeah, I guess it's my research.

8
0:01:15.910000-->0:02:02.930000
 I think just like, maybe for example, the shapes we take from other people's faces, but we fill in the textures, maybe, or like skin tones, that kind of thing, you mean?

9
0:02:02.970000-->0:02:24.470000
 Yeah, fill in the blanks for memory.

10
0:02:43.140000-->0:02:45.200000
 I'm not in Glasgow at the moment.

11
0:02:47.250000-->0:02:56.950000
 I was in Glasgow for like the past two years, but I had to move out for a bit, because my housing situation changed a little bit.

12
0:02:56.950000-->0:02:58.190000
 I'm in Leeds right now.

13
0:02:58.210000-->0:03:01.340000
 Yeah, so it's not too far.

14
0:03:02.100000-->0:03:05.820000
 I can move to Glasgow every now and then if I need to be in person, so.

15
0:03:16-->0:03:16.500000
 Yeah, yeah.

16
0:03:16.880000-->0:03:17.640000
 Yeah.

17
0:03:24.100000-->0:03:30.690000
 I think it's nice and snowy already there.

18
0:03:37.580000-->0:03:46.500000
 Yeah, I'm going for Christmas as well, but I don't know if it's going to snow really where I'm in the part that I live in.

19
0:03:47.250000-->0:03:50.020000
 It's usually because the mountain range that gets quite snowy.

20
0:03:50.020000-->0:03:57.640000
 So I'm like bang on in the middle, towards the left.

21
0:03:57.640000-->0:03:59.200000
 I'm like two hours away from Berlin.

22
0:04:00.680000-->0:04:07.370000
 It's a tiny town, but if you know Poznan, it's a bigger city.

23
0:04:08.050000-->0:04:08.450000
 Yeah.
