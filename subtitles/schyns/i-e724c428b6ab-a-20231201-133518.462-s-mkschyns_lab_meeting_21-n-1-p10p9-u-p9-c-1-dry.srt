0
0:00:15.920000-->0:00:24.850000
 Yes, I think, I skipped the instructions too quickly, so I don't know what it was saying

1
0:00:24.850000-->0:00:25.850000
 in the instructions.

2
0:00:25.850000-->0:00:29.780000
 Maybe I'll ask in the chat.

3
0:00:48.130000-->0:00:52.150000
 So we're probably being manipulated somehow, one way or the other, I guess, right?

4
0:00:57.110000-->0:00:57.690000
 It's hard.

5
0:00:57.910000-->0:00:58.570000
 I have to laugh.

6
0:00:58.910000-->0:01:01.430000
 I have to think of death.

7
0:01:09.420000-->0:01:11.040000
 You seem quite smiley.

8
0:01:15.940000-->0:01:15.960000
 Okay.

9
0:01:15.960000-->0:01:19.240000
 Is there any updates yet?

10
0:01:19.480000-->0:01:21.220000
 What's the context of the conversation?

11
0:01:21.220000-->0:01:23.360000
 Yeah, we don't know what the context is.

12
0:01:24.590000-->0:01:26.710000
 So we can just maybe talk about anything.

13
0:01:29.780000-->0:01:35.140000
 Flying to BesanÃ§on on Tuesday to meet JJ.

14
0:01:36.380000-->0:01:38.580000
 Yeah, interesting.

15
0:01:41.850000-->0:01:42.950000
 Yes, yeah.

16
0:01:44.140000-->0:01:47
 And then TGV to BesanÃ§on.

17
0:01:49.390000-->0:01:53.840000
 Last time I was in France was probably six, seven years ago.

18
0:01:53.840000-->0:01:56.140000
 So quite keen to.

19
0:02:00.620000-->0:02:05.840000
 I think I have like five hours in Paris of layover, but it's kind of, I think, enough

20
0:02:05.840000-->0:02:09.280000
 to get to the airport and sit there and drink a coffee maybe.

21
0:02:09.280000-->0:02:16.410000
 So unfortunately, no.

22
0:02:18.190000-->0:02:23.680000
 Just getting back here and it would have been cool to be in Paris.

23
0:02:29.120000-->0:02:29.140000
 Okay.

24
0:02:29.280000-->0:02:30.060000
 Sounds good.

25
0:02:31.030000-->0:02:31.050000
 Yeah.

26
0:02:32.210000-->0:02:32.230000
 Yeah.

27
0:02:34.020000-->0:02:39.800000
 At least I can ask JJ if, because he's supposed to come here for a talk, for a Friday seminar

28
0:02:39.800000-->0:02:40.180000
 talk.

29
0:02:40.980000-->0:02:44.020000
 But it's like finding a date seems to be quite difficult with him.

30
0:02:44.020000-->0:02:49.320000
 And so the hope is at least I can try to get that somehow fixed so he can come here.

31
0:02:49.740000-->0:02:54.410000
 Okay.

32
0:02:54.410000-->0:02:56.950000
 So the context is we're supposed to talk about cognitive science.

33
0:02:56.950000-->0:03:02.950000
 That's actually arguably the best topic to talk about with Philippe Schintz.

34
0:03:03.130000-->0:03:10.510000
 So Carlos, yeah, it looks cool.

35
0:03:10.510000-->0:03:16.810000
 I mean, it's, it has this element of like, right, like using the P3 component, which

36
0:03:16.810000-->0:03:21.030000
 is probably kind of a bottleneck in the end, I could imagine.

37
0:03:21.030000-->0:03:26.030000
 Like I could imagine you could increase the bit rate of readout if you kind of don't focus

38
0:03:26.030000-->0:03:27.190000
 on a fixed component.

39
0:03:27.490000-->0:03:32.190000
 But it's really nice to see kind of from a neuroscience perspective, then what you can

40
0:03:32.190000-->0:03:33.190000
 do with that component.

41
0:03:34.630000-->0:03:34.650000
 Right.

42
0:03:34.650000-->0:03:35.510000
 So, so yeah, that's, that's cool.

43
0:03:41.680000-->0:03:41.700000
 Yeah.

44
0:03:42.040000-->0:03:42.200000
 Yeah.

45
0:03:51.920000-->0:03:52.080000
 Yeah.

46
0:04:02.440000-->0:04:02.460000
 Yeah.

47
0:04:02.520000-->0:04:02.800000
 Yeah.

48
0:04:04.040000-->0:04:04.140000
 Yeah.

49
0:04:08.210000-->0:04:08.230000
 Yeah.

50
0:04:09.010000-->0:04:09.030000
 Yeah.

51
0:04:09.030000-->0:04:09.230000
 Yeah.

52
0:04:09.230000-->0:04:09.370000
 Yeah.

53
0:04:09.370000-->0:04:09.630000
 Yeah.

54
0:04:09.630000-->0:04:09.710000
 Yeah.

55
0:04:09.710000-->0:04:09.790000
 Yeah.

56
0:04:09.790000-->0:04:09.890000
 Yeah.

57
0:04:09.890000-->0:04:09.910000
 Yeah.

58
0:04:09.910000-->0:04:09.920000
 Yeah.

59
0:04:09.930000-->0:04:09.950000
 Yeah.

60
0:04:09.950000-->0:04:09.970000
 Yeah.
