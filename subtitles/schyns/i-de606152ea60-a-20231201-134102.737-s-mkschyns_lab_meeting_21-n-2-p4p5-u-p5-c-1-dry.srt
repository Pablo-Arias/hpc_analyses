 I'm good. How about you? Yes. Do you understand? I mean, I'm not familiar with this research.

1
0:00:31.710000-->0:02:31.230000
 Yes. Yes. That's a very interesting direction, I think. Especially, I can see the complexity

2
0:02:31.230000-->0:02:40.490000
 in this study, because, I mean, the sound is a temporal signal, and the visual expression

3
0:02:40.490000-->0:03:00.370000
 is actually also a temporal signal of model. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's exactly what I mean.

4
0:03:00.630000-->0:03:08.430000
 And even, I mean, for the future, if we can combine the face research and the brain research

5
0:03:08.550000-->0:03:15.190000
 that we combine this face data, some data, and brain data, that's all.

6
0:03:23.460000-->0:03:57.850000
 Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. So, I mean, the interaction between sound and facial movements,

7
0:03:57.850000-->0:04:06.110000
 so you only studied in behavior level now. Yeah. Yeah.
