 hello yeah the sound is a little you can't you can't hear me now you can't

1
0:00:29.250000-->0:01:04.030000
 hear me I can't hear you but can you hear me you can't hear me now yes

2
0:01:10.570000-->0:01:24.940000
 yeah yeah it's a Chinese name nice to meet you it looks like he asked me he

3
0:01:24.940000-->0:02:28.180000
 asked us to talk about the future of cognitive neuroscience to me what I do

4
0:02:28.180000-->0:02:35.400000
 is to explain the cognitive processes in our brain and the ultimate goal is to

5
0:02:35.400000-->0:02:41.880000
 create intelligence like a human but I something this this part of me is that I

6
0:02:41.880000-->0:02:48.580000
 don't think what I do can achieve that that goal and it looks like the current

7
0:02:48.580000-->0:02:57.480000
 AI development have already done some kind of like a large language model but

8
0:02:57.480000-->0:03:03.720000
 we can do that model but we still don't understand how we achieve such kind of

9
0:03:03.720000-->0:03:11.020000
 intelligence so I think the same analysis approach that we used to study

10
0:03:11.020000-->0:03:21.140000
 our brain can be used to study like LLM or other AI models and we can like

11
0:03:21.140000-->0:04:07.500000
 compare AI models and human brain like this kind of research yeah yes nice to

12
0:04:07.500000-->0:04:08.180000
 meet you yeah
