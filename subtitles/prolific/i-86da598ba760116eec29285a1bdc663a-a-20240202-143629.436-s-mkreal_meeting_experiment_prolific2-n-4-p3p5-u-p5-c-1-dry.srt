 Hi there. Hi. I just caught you with a mouthful. That's fine. No worries, I'll start. I'm Sue,

1
0:00:27.410000-->0:00:36.030000
 I live in Leeds and I came to university in Leeds in 1989 and ended up staying here and

2
0:00:36.030000-->0:00:44
 I obviously work here now. So where are you in the UK? Manchester, near Manchester, Cheshire area.

3
0:00:49.100000-->0:01:09.720000
 Oh, really? Whereabouts in Manchester? Oh, brilliant. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, brilliant. So

4
0:01:09.720000-->0:01:20.340000
 do you, are you enjoying life in the UK? Yeah, there's a lot going on, isn't there? And quite

5
0:01:20.340000-->0:01:25.880000
 a lot of culture, very multicultural and I like that about it. Leeds is very much the same as

6
0:01:25.880000-->0:01:36.290000
 well. I think I came to university, I made a lot of friends and I like, I just really like the

7
0:01:36.290000-->0:01:42.130000
 fact that 15 minutes one way you can be in the beautiful Dales countryside and 15 minutes the

8
0:01:42.130000-->0:01:47.450000
 other way you've got all the, you know, the hustle and bustle of the city centre and so the best of

9
0:01:47.450000-->0:01:53.970000
 both worlds and not too far away from Manchester either and because I used to have a season ticket

10
0:01:53.970000-->0:02:07.840000
 at Manchester City so I could still go back. Oh, really? Yeah, my granddad took me to watch

11
0:02:07.840000-->0:02:14.360000
 Manchester City when I was five years old and I'm nearly, I'm nearly 54 now and still, I still go.

12
0:02:14.360000-->0:02:22.350000
 So, yeah. It is, it's a, all the, all the different generations of my family go, they all sit in the

13
0:02:22.350000-->0:02:27.930000
 stadium in different parts. I've got my sister and my mum and my nephews and nieces and they're,

14
0:02:27.930000-->0:02:38.400000
 they're all, they all sit in the same area. Yeah. Yeah, it is, it's like part of your identity,

15
0:02:38.400000-->0:03:05.850000
 isn't it? A sense of belonging and so, do you work? Oh, good luck with those then, yeah. And

16
0:03:05.850000-->0:03:19.250000
 are they based in Manchester? Yeah, I am, I work as a counsellor. I used to be the head of the

17
0:03:19.250000-->0:03:24.430000
 counselling service at the university. I left that a few years ago because my health wasn't

18
0:03:24.430000-->0:03:30.590000
 brilliant and so I just work part-time now, privately, from home, which works well,

19
0:03:30.590000-->0:03:36.760000
 gives me a better life balance, but still, you know, gives me a sense of purpose and value,

20
0:03:36.760000-->0:03:48.200000
 really. So, I like it, it's nice to have. I've got, I'm disabled and it's sort of a chronic

21
0:03:48.200000-->0:03:54.160000
 sort of situation but I think I feel a lot better now I don't have the pressure of the

22
0:03:54.160000-->0:03:58.560000
 full-time job. Oh, gosh, that went really quickly. Our conversation's over in 15 seconds.

23
0:03:58.760000-->0:04:06.740000
 Yeah, and you, and hope you do well, you know, get the job that you want next week.

24
0:04:06.740000-->0:04:09.840000
 All right, have a lovely weekend.
