0:00:10.950000-->0:00:16.350000
 Hi. I can hear you well. Can you hear me?

1
0:00:16.350000-->0:00:16.410000
 Yes.

2
0:00:22.810000-->0:00:24.290000
 Oh, really?

3
0:00:35.750000-->0:00:43.960000
 With four people, four people, four minutes each, but you are my fourth person.

4
0:00:43.960000-->0:00:48.600000
 And I didn't have any problems.

5
0:00:49.640000-->0:00:49.960000
 No.

6
0:00:51.300000-->0:00:51.980000
 Yeah.

7
0:00:58.400000-->0:01:00.880000
 I'm in Brentwood, Essex.

8
0:01:02.860000-->0:01:03.300000
 Yes.

9
0:01:04-->0:01:08.880000
 Oh, I heard about it.

10
0:01:09.200000-->0:01:09.520000
 Yeah.

11
0:01:09.520000-->0:01:11.140000
 I heard about it.

12
0:01:11.300000-->0:01:13.060000
 That's good.

13
0:01:16.750000-->0:01:17.630000
 Yes.

14
0:01:17.630000-->0:01:24.030000
 Actually, the trains were not running this weekend from Brentwood, so we were stuck.

15
0:01:24.030000-->0:01:26.210000
 We were not stuck, but we couldn't really go.

16
0:01:26.210000-->0:01:34.350000
 Usually, we like to go in London with my husband to explore, but this weekend we stayed locally here, and it was nice.

17
0:01:34.350000-->0:01:35.190000
 It was nice.

18
0:01:39.040000-->0:01:39.340000
 Yeah.

19
0:01:39.340000-->0:01:45.040000
 It's a nice high street, so there are different places to sit and eat.

20
0:01:45.040000-->0:01:46.620000
 We have a park.

21
0:01:46.620000-->0:01:49.940000
 There is a really nice part of Brentwood.

22
0:01:49.940000-->0:01:56.500000
 In the past, it was a psychiatric hospital, but they turned it into a really fancy apartment.

23
0:01:56.500000-->0:01:59.960000
 So it's a really nice part to go around.

24
0:02:53.590000-->0:02:55.290000
 How long are you in politics?

25
0:02:56.150000-->0:02:57.630000
 For how long are you in politics?

26
0:02:59.650000-->0:03:00.510000
 Okay.

27
0:03:47.900000-->0:03:48
 There are so many people.

28
0:03:48-->0:03:53.500000
 There are good things about AI, but there are some disturbing and scary things.

29
0:03:57.980000-->0:03:58.300000
 Yeah.

30
0:03:58.500000-->0:03:59.920000
 What's your name, just to know?

31
0:04:01.710000-->0:04:02.410000
 I'm Arlene.

32
0:04:03.050000-->0:04:04.050000
 Jagoda.

33
0:04:04.930000-->0:04:05.230000
