 Hi there, how are you doing? I'm alright, not bad. This is a random experiment to be

1
0:00:20.290000-->0:00:35.170000
 doing, isn't it? It is, it's very strange. But I was saying to the last girl I chatted

2
0:00:35.170000-->0:00:40.550000
 to, it's been all females I've spoken to. I don't know if you've been the same. Yeah.

3
0:00:42.400000-->0:01:04.760000
 Wow. Yeah. Yeah, well I'm up north, I'm in Scotland. So, alright, so I'm the other side,

4
0:01:04.760000-->0:01:15.870000
 I'm Aberdeen, so I'm the east coast. We've got about a foot of snow at the moment. Yeah,

5
0:01:16.090000-->0:01:39.070000
 so very cold. But beautiful to look at. No. Yeah, okay. No, well even here, like our country

6
0:01:39.070000-->0:01:43.910000
 schools, like I'm in the city, but the ones like kind of out with the city centre, they're

7
0:01:43.910000-->0:01:55.720000
 all closed. But you can't get to them, it's the transport that's the issue. Yeah. I've

8
0:01:55.720000-->0:02:01.540000
 got two dogs, so I have to go out in the snow. Yeah, I'm permanently out walking them,

9
0:02:01.540000-->0:02:12.110000
 so they love the snow. Have you? I've got two Cocker Spaniels, so I've got one that's

10
0:02:12.110000-->0:02:17.590000
 three years old and I've just got a puppy in November, so he's now four months old.

11
0:02:18.350000-->0:02:36.940000
 What about you? Okay. It was fine. I've done it before, but the dogs, my other dog was

12
0:02:36.940000-->0:02:42.340000
 a lot older. He was nine when we got our puppy. So this time around it has been so

13
0:02:42.340000-->0:02:49.500000
 much easier and our dog's still quite playful. So, you know, they're a perfect match. You

14
0:02:49.500000-->0:02:54.580000
 know, they have their odd squabbles and things, but it's brilliant. You know, they lie curled

15
0:02:54.580000-->0:03:05.700000
 up together. So yeah, I would recommend it. It's hard work. It really is hard work. It

16
0:03:05.700000-->0:03:09.820000
 is at the moment, because obviously the little one can't walk the same as the older one.

17
0:03:10.180000-->0:03:15.920000
 So you're sort of restricted walks and things. But once they both are up walking, you know,

18
0:03:15.920000-->0:03:20.580000
 their Spaniels will walk for hours. But at the moment it's that restricted walking. So

19
0:03:20.580000-->0:03:34.100000
 he's just manic in the house. There's no off switch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But no, it's really

20
0:03:34.100000-->0:03:55.360000
 good fun. I would recommend it. Yeah. Apart from the vet bills, that's probably the downside.

21
0:03:58.250000-->0:04:07.800000
 Yeah. So double the cost, but they entertain each other. So yeah. Yeah. Well, that's it.

22
0:04:08.810000-->0:04:09.710000
 Nice to meet you.
