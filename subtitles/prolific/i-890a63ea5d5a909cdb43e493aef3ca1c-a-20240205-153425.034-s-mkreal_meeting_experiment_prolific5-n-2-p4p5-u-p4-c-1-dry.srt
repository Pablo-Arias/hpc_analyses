0:00:11.450000-->0:00:11.850000
 Hello?

1
0:00:13.950000-->0:00:17.510000
 You can turn your volume up a bit, I think.

2
0:00:17.930000-->0:00:18.990000
 I can't quite hear you.

3
0:00:23.400000-->0:00:24.960000
 You're very faint.

4
0:00:24.960000-->0:00:28.530000
 Um, is your volume fully up?

5
0:00:31.100000-->0:00:32.070000
 Is it?

6
0:00:32.070000-->0:00:34.650000
 Okay, um, can you hear me okay?

7
0:00:34.650000-->0:00:38.030000
 Yeah, okay.

8
0:00:38.030000-->0:00:41.170000
 You're very faint, but I can just hear you.

9
0:00:41.510000-->0:00:42.750000
 How are you?

10
0:00:42.850000-->0:00:46.680000
 Good.

11
0:00:47.500000-->0:00:49.380000
 Whereabouts do you live?

12
0:00:55.600000-->0:00:57.850000
 Sorry, I didn't quite get that.

13
0:01:02.730000-->0:01:04.010000
 Oh, right, okay, cool.

14
0:01:04.350000-->0:01:08.830000
 I live in North Wales, just over the border from the English.

15
0:01:09.650000-->0:01:11.880000
 Have you heard of Chester?

16
0:01:14.600000-->0:01:20.400000
 Yeah, so about five or so miles from there, basically.

17
0:01:20.600000-->0:01:22.660000
 Not too far.

18
0:01:22.660000-->0:01:23.940000
 Yeah.

19
0:01:29.090000-->0:01:30.030000
 I was, sorry?

20
0:01:33.900000-->0:01:34.960000
 How did it go?

21
0:01:35.900000-->0:01:41.960000
 It was a bit, um, I think there was a bit of a delay or something.

22
0:01:42.300000-->0:01:49.660000
 He couldn't quite hear me, but I keep repeating, and then when he heard me,

23
0:01:49.700000-->0:01:55.440000
 and then he replied to me, so it was a bit awkward, but, you know.

24
0:01:55.700000-->0:02:00.660000
 What's quite cool, though, was I'm originally from South Africa,

25
0:02:00.700000-->0:02:06.340000
 and he's from, he was from Nigeria, and he moved over three years ago.

26
0:02:06.340000-->0:02:08.620000
 We moved 15, 16 years ago.

27
0:02:09.160000-->0:02:12.100000
 So, small world, as they say.

28
0:02:13.850000-->0:02:17.840000
 So, are you studying, or?

29
0:02:27.350000-->0:02:28.570000
 Okay, cool.

30
0:02:29.050000-->0:02:32.950000
 Oh, yeah, I haven't been working for a while.

31
0:02:34.050000-->0:02:40.310000
 I had health issues, so not able to work, really.

32
0:02:42.250000-->0:02:44.930000
 Don't know where the time's gone, though.

33
0:02:45.250000-->0:02:47.590000
 It just seems to disappear.

34
0:02:48.700000-->0:02:54.610000
 It's like, sorry?

35
0:02:54.610000-->0:03:02.530000
 Yeah.

36
0:03:03.050000-->0:03:07.250000
 But it's like, it kind of feels like you're living as a pensioner.

37
0:03:10.050000-->0:03:16.630000
 You just kind of do whatever, and you fill your days with other things,

38
0:03:16.630000-->0:03:19.910000
 and you kind of think, what if I got a job?

39
0:03:19.910000-->0:03:21.630000
 I'd never be able to do all these things.

40
0:03:22.050000-->0:03:28.650000
 But, yeah, you're literally on one day, and then you pretty much blink,

41
0:03:28.650000-->0:03:31.310000
 and it's the next week or something.

42
0:03:31.310000-->0:03:33.450000
 You're like, where did the week go?

43
0:03:34.250000-->0:03:38.110000
 So, yeah, it's just mad.

44
0:03:38.250000-->0:03:43.380000
 It's like, before I knew it, like, the last month has just flown by.

45
0:03:45.400000-->0:03:46.420000
 I don't know.

46
0:03:55.250000-->0:03:56.480000
 January.

47
0:03:57-->0:04:01.630000
 Well, I guess it also starts getting lighter in February, doesn't it?

48
0:04:01.630000-->0:04:05.430000
 My mom was saying the other day, no, this morning,

49
0:04:05.430000-->0:04:09.430000
 that because she gets up quite early and it's getting lighter.
