 Hello? Hi, can you hear me okay? Yes I can. Yes.

1
0:00:32.350000-->0:00:38.040000
 How are you? I'm good.

2
0:00:40.550000-->0:00:47.060000
 Oh no, I'm at home. Are you at work?

3
0:00:50.150000-->0:00:54.170000
 No. Yeah, this is very weird.

4
0:00:54.170000-->0:01:00.720000
 I guess. Oh, I live in Medway in Kent.

5
0:01:04.250000-->0:01:09.090000
 Yeah. Oh, we're just supposed to chat.

6
0:01:14.900000-->0:01:17.910000
 Yeah. But where do you live?

7
0:01:21.650000-->0:01:29.460000
 Where do you live? Oh, okay. I love Birmingham.

8
0:01:29.460000-->0:01:35.920000
 Mostly because I went to Leicester Uni and so it was easy to get to and I went there a lot.

9
0:01:39.600000-->0:01:43
 Yeah. No. Are you?

10
0:01:49.750000-->0:01:53.770000
 Yeah. Do you have any fun things that you like to do in Birmingham?

11
0:02:04.700000-->0:02:12.370000
 Okay. And you don't enjoy going to the museum? I really like the museum when I used to go there.

12
0:02:29.250000-->0:02:42.070000
 Yeah, now that makes sense. But you will. I think Birmingham is quite good because it's quite diverse and there are a lot of things to do and it's growing.

13
0:02:44.450000-->0:02:52.710000
 Yeah. Yeah, you will. But what made you move over to Birmingham?

14
0:03:04.400000-->0:03:15.940000
 Okay. Yeah, my family had to do the same thing. I'm from Zimbabwe and my dad got a job in America and so we moved to America and then he got a job in the UK so we moved to the UK.
