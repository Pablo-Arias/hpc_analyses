 Hiya, how are you? Oh nice, my name's Raj and I'm from Birmingham, so the West Midlands of the UK.

1
0:00:42.100000-->0:00:52.970000
 Oh nice, well it's it's a fairly standard city really, you get the usual stuff but I've been

2
0:00:52.970000-->0:00:58.230000
 to, the only place in Scotland I've been to is Edinburgh and Edinburgh was lovely.

3
0:00:58.230000-->0:01:29.460000
 Okay, that's not too bad, yeah I've always wanted to go to Glasgow, I don't know what's around there

4
0:01:29.460000-->0:01:35.220000
 but I really loved going to Edinburgh, I thought it'd be nice to see different areas of Scotland

5
0:01:35.220000-->0:01:47.260000
 as well in the future. Yeah sure, so I work for a telecoms business in their commercial team,

6
0:01:47.260000-->0:02:03.570000
 looking at policy mainly. How about you? Yes it is, yeah. Yeah I do, when I'm in the office, yeah.

7
0:02:13.950000-->0:02:47.700000
 Oh okay, lovely. And did you enjoy being a midwife? Yeah, I can imagine shift work, my husband works

8
0:02:47.700000-->0:02:53.140000
 shifts and it can be quite difficult like pattern, like work pattern wise and obviously it takes a

9
0:02:53.140000-->0:02:57.660000
 toll on like, you know, your sleeping pattern and your health a bit as well, long term I guess.

10
0:03:03.150000-->0:03:13.500000
 Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure you, you know, helped a lot of people so I'm sure it sounds like a very

11
0:03:13.500000-->0:03:22.010000
 satisfying role. Yes, I'm married, yeah we've been married for about four and a half years.

12
0:03:22.010000-->0:03:51.930000
 How about you? Are you? Okay. Oh nice, fair enough. Of course, and it's got to be with the right

13
0:03:51.930000-->0:03:58.010000
 person otherwise it's, you know, there's no point. But no, I've just seen the 15 seconds come up and

14
0:03:58.010000-->0:04:06.770000
 that time's gone very quickly. But you two, it was really nice to meet you and I hope you have a lovely

15
0:04:06.770000-->0:04:08.230000
 rest of the day and weekend.
