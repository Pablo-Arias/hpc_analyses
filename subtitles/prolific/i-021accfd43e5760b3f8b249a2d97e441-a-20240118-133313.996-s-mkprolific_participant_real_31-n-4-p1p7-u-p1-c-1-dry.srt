 Hiya. Can you hear me?

1
0:00:20-->0:00:21.960000
 Yes, I'm actually the researcher.

2
0:00:22.500000-->0:00:25.480000
 But I think there was a problem with this interaction.

3
0:00:27.500000-->0:00:32.380000
 I think, were you able to interact before with someone?

4
0:00:39.530000-->0:00:42.190000
 Yeah, yeah, I think they dropped out.

5
0:00:42.190000-->0:00:43.950000
 So that's why.

6
0:00:43.950000-->0:00:46.390000
 That's why you're not seeing anything.

7
0:00:46.950000-->0:00:49.430000
 Did the other ones went all right?

8
0:00:50.450000-->0:00:55.260000
 Well, OK, so the research is going fine.

9
0:00:55.400000-->0:00:57.780000
 But we had this participant that dropped out.

10
0:00:57.780000-->0:01:02.300000
 So it's just messes with everything.

11
0:01:02.400000-->0:01:03.740000
 But it's OK.

12
0:01:06.100000-->0:01:09.210000
 Anyway, thank you very much for participating.

13
0:01:09.210000-->0:01:14.170000
 And it will just move on.

14
0:01:14.170000-->0:01:17.030000
 And if you can, at the end of the experiment, you have a box.

15
0:01:17.050000-->0:01:25.970000
 And you can just add that you weren't able to interact with someone in the last round.

16
0:01:26.050000-->0:01:32.440000
 OK, great. Thank you very much. Bye.
