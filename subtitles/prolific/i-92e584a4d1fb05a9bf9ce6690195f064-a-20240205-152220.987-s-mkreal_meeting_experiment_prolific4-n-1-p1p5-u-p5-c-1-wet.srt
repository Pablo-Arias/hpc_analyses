0
0:00:11.050000-->0:00:20.640000
 How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Where are you from?

1
0:00:24.320000-->0:00:26.500000
 So, you are right now in Turkey?

2
0:00:26.500000-->0:00:29.610000
 No, I'm in the UK.

3
0:00:29.950000-->0:00:38.690000
 Alright. So, I'm from Macedonia originally, but I live in the UK now.

4
0:00:38.690000-->0:00:45.290000
 I came here to study and I'm not married and I'm in the last seven years in the UK.

5
0:00:45.290000-->0:00:52.700000
 Yes, I'm married into the British person, yes.

6
0:00:57.440000-->0:01:02.940000
 Okay. So, why did you came to the UK from Turkey?

7
0:01:02.940000-->0:01:21.390000
 Because I went to study abroad.

8
0:01:21.390000-->0:01:31.330000
 Yeah, it's very similar.

9
0:01:31.330000-->0:01:33.390000
 Yeah, very similar experience.

10
0:01:33.390000-->0:01:39.670000
 I got a scholarship to study in the UK.

11
0:01:39.670000-->0:01:42.970000
 I did my master's degree in business psychology.

12
0:01:43.150000-->0:01:46.830000
 But that was 2017, yes.

13
0:01:52.600000-->0:01:54.540000
 Exactly, yeah.

14
0:01:59.500000-->0:02:05.280000
 It's in Essex, about 30-40 minutes with train from London.

15
0:02:06.900000-->0:02:10.480000
 I like it very much, yeah.

16
0:02:10.480000-->0:02:16.860000
 It's more intimate, it's like around 100,000 people, but it's more nice.

17
0:02:16.860000-->0:02:21.040000
 It's like a more greeny, smaller street, so I like it.

18
0:02:21.040000-->0:02:24.180000
 We have a high street, so I do like it very much.

19
0:02:24.180000-->0:02:34.630000
 It's very green and small, but it's very close to the town.

20
0:02:36.750000-->0:02:38.430000
 Yes, yes.

21
0:02:52.330000-->0:02:52.390000
 So, it's good.

22
0:02:52.390000-->0:02:53.930000
 Exactly, yeah.

23
0:02:55.350000-->0:03:02.950000
 It's very like, when it's winter, the weather is not as warm as it used to be.

24
0:03:06.090000-->0:03:10.410000
 Yeah, the weather is the big downside here for me.

25
0:03:10.410000-->0:03:14.290000
 I love it, but the weather is really one big minus.

26
0:03:14.290000-->0:03:15.910000
 And what do you study?

27
0:03:21.480000-->0:03:21.500000
 English.

28
0:03:21.500000-->0:03:22.060000
 So, you're teaching English.

29
0:03:22.500000-->0:03:24.540000
 That's good, okay.

30
0:03:24.540000-->0:03:28.920000
 So, it's like a language university, yes, about our life.

31
0:03:31.480000-->0:03:31.500000
 Yeah.

32
0:03:31.500000-->0:03:32.400000
 That's good.

33
0:03:41.050000-->0:03:43.810000
 I'm trying to do something, right?

34
0:03:44.250000-->0:03:44.610000
 Yeah.

35
0:03:44.850000-->0:03:48.970000
 I'm going to do my degree.

36
0:03:52.420000-->0:03:52.760000
 Right.

37
0:03:56-->0:03:57.560000
 I'm trying to do it.

38
0:03:58.100000-->0:03:59.250000
 I'm trying to do it.

39
0:04:03-->0:04:03.820000
 I have to find a job.

40
0:04:06.120000-->0:04:08.100000
 Exactly, yeah.

41
0:04:08.520000-->0:04:08.880000
 Yeah.
