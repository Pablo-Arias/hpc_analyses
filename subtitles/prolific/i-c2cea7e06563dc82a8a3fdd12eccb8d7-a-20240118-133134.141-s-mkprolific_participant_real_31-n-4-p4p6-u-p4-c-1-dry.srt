 Hello, sorry, let me come back to you. I've just got a couple of the prolific thing. So

1
0:00:17.700000-->0:00:34.730000
 I was like, I got that on the first one, there was nobody there. So I was like, oh, it was

2
0:00:34.730000-->0:00:40.050000
 just frozen. Yeah, the picture of the girl. So I refreshed it and said nothing happened

3
0:00:40.050000-->0:00:51.500000
 at all. Hopefully not. I'm not too bad. I'm just had a new replacement. So I am at home.

4
0:00:51.980000-->0:00:58.420000
 So I'm five weeks into recovering from that. So that's why I'm this. I've had one done

5
0:00:58.420000-->0:01:05.140000
 before and this one's been a lot less painful than the previous one. So still painful, but

6
0:01:06.180000-->0:01:32.430000
 just be motivated to do the exercises and stuff. It's quite hard sometimes. Yeah, for

7
0:01:32.430000-->0:01:36.870000
 me, it's like the bend because you have to get it a certain degree for it to be a success.

8
0:01:36.870000-->0:01:42.910000
 And I've got it straight, but I'm not quite there on the bend. I think I'm plus 90, but

9
0:01:43.290000-->0:01:47.890000
 we'll see. Anyway, we'll get there. Yeah, I just want to go for a walk. I haven't been

10
0:01:48.250000-->0:01:52.710000
 stuck in the house, obviously, but I've been in my house for about two years whilst waiting for

11
0:01:52.710000-->0:02:06.890000
 this operation. So it's just been like, now I want to get out. Yeah. Yes. Up north. Yeah.

12
0:02:06.890000-->0:02:14.260000
 In the Midlands. It's been like this morning, it was minus seven. We couldn't believe it.

13
0:02:14.260000-->0:02:19.660000
 It was like flipping ink. So my partner works outside. So it's been horrendous for him the

14
0:02:19.660000-->0:02:22.880000
 last few days. Yeah. It's just like, I've had enough of this.

15
0:02:32.620000-->0:02:42.120000
 Have you got kids? Have you got kids at all? No. I've got three. So two boys and a girl.

16
0:02:42.980000-->0:02:49.820000
 One's 30, 40 this year, one of them is, and then the other one's 35. And then there's the baby

17
0:02:49.820000-->0:03:00.710000
 that's 22 at the moment. He's still at uni. So yeah. Not really, no, because I'm divorced. It's

18
0:03:02.500000-->0:03:05.960000
 broken families. What can you say? It's not so good.

19
0:03:23.800000-->0:03:32.340000
 But my daughter lives in New Mexico, in America. So I go out there about once a year. Oh God,

20
0:03:32.340000-->0:03:35.600000
 I don't know. They were in Vancouver before that. And that is just like,

21
0:03:35.600000-->0:03:41.480000
 amazing. If you ever get a chance to go there. But Santa Fe is just, yeah, definitely. It's just,

22
0:03:41.480000-->0:03:48.480000
 Canada is amazing. You want to go live there. Everything's so clean. The buses run on time.

23
0:03:48.480000-->0:03:53.860000
 I mean, okay. I know. Yeah. You know, if you want, if you have, if you need public transport,

24
0:03:53.860000-->0:03:58.740000
 it's there. Not like here, where all the conversation's over in 15 seconds. Sorry.

25
0:04:00.280000-->0:04:08.070000
 Hadn't you, sweetheart? Thank you very much, sweetie. Take care.
