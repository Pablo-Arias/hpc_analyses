9
0:01:18.090000-->0:01:27.710000
 because it is so cold yeah it's really really cold yeah no no I

10
0:01:27.710000-->0:01:32.010000
 haven't we drove I drove here at like 8 a.m. because I'm just at my sister's

11
0:01:32.010000-->0:01:37.870000
 house I'm just looking after her dog for the day but yeah I drove here at like

12
0:01:37.870000-->0:01:41.430000
 8 a.m. and there was some bits where water had obviously leaked from somewhere

13
0:01:41.430000-->0:01:46.270000
 and at that bit it was like covered in snow and ice but apart from that it was

14
0:01:46.270000-->0:01:56.720000
 fine so as long as it stays dry I'm hoping that it's not too bad yeah yeah

15
0:01:56.720000-->0:02:00.480000
 even like I literally walked like five minutes to the shop and I was like even

16
0:02:00.480000-->0:02:05.100000
 in your chest in like my head I was I almost felt like I had sort of like

17
0:02:05.100000-->0:02:10.140000
 brain freeze you know when you have like a really cold drink I was like like it's

18
0:02:10.140000-->0:02:20.590000
 just really it's pretty crazy yeah yeah yeah and I always say as well it's like

19
0:02:20.590000-->0:02:23.610000
 you get to December Christmas time and you're like oh this winter's been so

20
0:02:23.610000-->0:02:27.950000
 easy and then it's not until like January February and the beginning of

21
0:02:27.950000-->0:02:33.230000
 March it can like here and it's like or you think that you're nearly done and

22
0:02:33.230000-->0:02:43.200000
 then it gets really really cold yeah so I I work from home I do commodity

23
0:02:43.200000-->0:02:48.980000
 trading that's what I want to kind of do as a full-time thing but until you are

24
0:02:48.980000-->0:02:52.460000
 like confident enough and have your account big enough it's not really

25
0:02:52.460000-->0:02:57.860000
 workable as like a full-time income so I just do things like prolific and just

26
0:02:57.860000-->0:03:02.920000
 like other kind of just ad hoc things from home really that's what I do so

27
0:03:02.920000-->0:03:13.620000
 what did you say you work in IT yeah that's like the dream it's like it's

28
0:03:13.620000-->0:03:17.620000
 like a full-on I sometimes read stuff on like reddit and things and people are

29
0:03:17.620000-->0:03:21.700000
 like yeah I work full-time from home and then I just like log off or do whatever

30
0:03:21.700000-->0:03:27.700000
 whenever a prolific pops up and I'm like that's so nice yeah I think there's

31
0:03:27.700000-->0:03:31.480000
 so many ways to earn money on the internet that people just don't realize

32
0:03:31.480000-->0:03:36.340000
 and it's like doing things like prolific even if you do one or two a week it's

33
0:03:36.340000-->0:03:45.370000
 like you can earn so much more just additional income it's so good yeah yeah

34
0:03:45.370000-->0:03:50.410000
 I did I yeah I did my self-assessment literally in bed like two days ago it

35
0:03:50.410000-->0:03:54.570000
 was the first frosty day and I opened the curtain it was frosty and I was like

36
0:03:54.570000-->0:03:57.810000
 I am sitting in bed and I'm getting this done because it had been stressing me

37
0:03:57.810000-->0:04:09.660000
 out so much yeah yeah no yeah have a good day I hope you
