 Hello.

1
0:00:00.820000-->0:00:05.830000
 All right, you're right.

2
0:00:11.280000-->0:00:11.800000
 My name is Michelle.

3
0:00:11.800000-->0:00:11.880000
 England.

4
0:00:14.340000-->0:00:15.480000
 Are you in England?

5
0:00:21.710000-->0:00:22.390000
 I've never heard of that before.

6
0:00:28.270000-->0:00:28.550000
 I'm in Hull.

7
0:00:30.930000-->0:00:30.950000
 Really?

8
0:00:30.950000-->0:00:31.970000
 Yes, I'm in Hull.

9
0:00:52.660000-->0:00:55.920000
 I think after I would go and look it up because I've never heard of the name before.

10
0:00:56.780000-->0:00:56.800000
 Really?

11
0:00:57.780000-->0:00:57.820000
 Oh, wow.

12
0:00:58.780000-->0:00:58.820000
 That's interesting.

13
0:01:01.310000-->0:01:01.750000
 I did not know.

14
0:01:18.910000-->0:01:28.420000
 You know, when I say I'll speak for myself, we don't really know our sides, Manchester,

15
0:01:28.420000-->0:01:33.190000
 Birmingham, London, you know, I've never heard of that before.

16
0:01:46.480000-->0:01:50.700000
 So like the countryside in the Midlands must be interesting.

17
0:01:56.860000-->0:01:58.320000
 Is it as cold?

18
0:02:11.170000-->0:02:11.250000
 I hate the cold.

19
0:02:11.250000-->0:02:11.970000
 I have multiple layers on and I'm inside.

20
0:02:12.990000-->0:02:14.170000
 I'm very cold.

21
0:02:14.170000-->0:02:16.130000
 I don't like the cold.

22
0:02:16.130000-->0:02:17.130000
 I can imagine.

23
0:02:17.130000-->0:02:22.830000
 I would have thought that it would be as bubbly as it is in London.

24
0:02:41.900000-->0:03:03.910000
 Before I can understand you clearly, I need to Google your place.

25
0:03:04.050000-->0:03:05.530000
 I've learnt something to this.

26
0:03:05.530000-->0:03:06.470000
 I need to Google it.

27
0:03:06.470000-->0:03:07.750000
 I think I might visit.

28
0:03:07.750000-->0:03:09.450000
 this is something new

29
0:03:10.110000-->0:03:11.450000

37
0:03:52.750000-->0:03:53.330000
 laughing
