0
0:00:10.350000-->0:00:21.100000
 Yeah, I'm good, thank you, yeah. Yeah, can you hear me? Okay, the last person I had just

1
0:00:21.100000-->0:00:25.680000
 completely froze, so I just had to like sit there staring at a frozen screen for a while

2
0:00:25.680000-->0:00:40.800000
 and I was like, I don't know what to do. Yeah, I guess. Oh, thank you so much. It's recently

3
0:00:40.800000-->0:00:44.440000
 been dyed, it doesn't stay this red for very long, so once I've washed it a couple of times

4
0:00:44.440000-->0:00:58.120000
 it'll fade out. Aww, that's such a compliment, thank you. Yeah, I'm based in Manchester,

5
0:00:58.120000-->0:01:08.330000
 yeah, what about you? Oh, hi. Oh, cool. Yeah, do you work from home? Oh, okay. Yeah, I've

6
0:01:08.330000-->0:01:12.050000
 no idea where the last person I spoke to were from because we didn't manage to have a conversation

7
0:01:12.050000-->0:01:20.340000
 at all, so. Yeah, it was like, hi, hi, and then nothing. I was like, I'm sure that's

8
0:01:20.340000-->0:01:24.660000
 their, sorry, I'm sure it's their connection, not mine, because I was like, I know that

9
0:01:24.660000-->0:01:37.190000
 I have, I don't tend to have issues usually with like Zoom and stuff. Oh, okay. Yes, it's

10
0:01:37.190000-->0:01:47.770000
 working so far. Yeah, yeah, and I was just like, I don't know, and then I was like, I

11
0:01:47.770000-->0:01:51.170000
 don't know if they can still see me or not, so I was just like, do I carry on chatting

12
0:01:51.170000-->0:02:01.290000
 or not, so just. Yeah, it's all good. Yeah, kind of. Well, I was just like, I'm just gonna

13
0:02:01.290000-->0:02:11.950000
 not say anything, because otherwise I'm just talking to myself. I've started going bouldering,

14
0:02:12.710000-->0:02:18.630000
 so I did that on Sunday. No, it's in Manchester City Centre, it's near the, a place near the

15
0:02:18.630000-->0:02:32.590000
 arena, so it's like dead easy to get to. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's that place, that's

16
0:02:32.590000-->0:02:45.300000
 where I go, yeah. Yeah, I started going a couple of months ago. Yeah. Yeah, oh, totally.

17
0:02:45.300000-->0:02:49.220000
 No, I mean, I tend to not go up too high, just because I'm the same, I don't like going

18
0:02:49.220000-->0:02:52.720000
 massively high, and then, but I've got this really bad habit of like, when I get to the

19
0:02:52.720000-->0:02:55.720000
 top, I'm like, okay, I'm done now, and I just let go and let myself drop, and I'm like,

20
0:02:55.720000-->0:03:01.300000
 I should really stop doing that, because it's really bad for your knees. I don't, not from

21
0:03:01.300000-->0:03:06.480000
 like too high, but like, yeah, because it's all like mats and stuff at the bottom, so

22
0:03:06.480000-->0:03:09.400000
 I'm just like, I'll just let myself drop on the mat, but I need to stop doing that, because

23
0:03:09.400000-->0:03:15.090000
 I don't think that's a very good thing. No, I've like, you know, like when you like bend

24
0:03:15.090000-->0:03:18.950000
 your wrist a bit funny and stuff like that, I've done that, but like, I've never like

25
0:03:18.970000-->0:03:26.520000
 seriously injured myself yet. Not yet, no, because I only started a couple months ago,

26
0:03:26.520000-->0:03:31.380000
 so I don't know how like, how into it I want to get if I want to buy all this stuff, because

27
0:03:31.380000-->0:03:35.360000
 you can buy like the shoes and stuff, but they're like 70 quid, and I don't know if

28
0:03:35.360000-->0:03:41.430000
 I'm that committed yet. Yeah, well, that's the thing, and people keep saying like, oh,

29
0:03:41.430000-->0:03:46.250000
 you'll get so much better, because they're like multi-feet if you buy your own, so I'm

30
0:03:46.250000-->0:03:55.980000
 a bit like, yeah. No, none at all, like, so that's kind of the reason why I started, because

31
0:03:55.980000-->0:03:59.880000
 I was like, I've got no strength. Tell me what you did at the weekend, quickly.

32
0:03:59.880000-->0:04:08.440000
 Oh, okay. Oh, cool.
