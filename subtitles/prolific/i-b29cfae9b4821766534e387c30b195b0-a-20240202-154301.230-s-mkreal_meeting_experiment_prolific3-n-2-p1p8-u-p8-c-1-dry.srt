 Hello. Hello, are you okay? Doing anything nice for the weekend?

1
0:00:35.780000-->0:00:36.700000
 Oh, so do I.

2
0:00:41.040000-->0:00:44.380000
 Oh, right. Where do you live?

3
0:00:44.380000-->0:00:47
 Well, yeah, I've got...

4
0:00:47-->0:01:05.870000
 Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

5
0:01:05.870000-->0:01:11.180000
 It sounds like you live in a very hilly place, because I do.

6
0:01:11.180000-->0:01:15.200000
 I live in North Devon, and it's very hilly here. Yeah.

7
0:01:16-->0:01:21.380000
 Which I still love, but I've got bad knees now.

8
0:01:21.400000-->0:01:34.190000
 Hmm. Yeah.

9
0:01:34.710000-->0:01:36.430000
 See, we're lucky we've got, like...

10
0:01:36.430000-->0:01:39.730000
 We've got all the countryside, but we're five, ten minutes' drive from the sea.

11
0:01:39.730000-->0:01:42.910000
 So it's great, really. We're lucky, you know.

12
0:01:42.910000-->0:01:46.150000
 And I like the sea when it's in the winter without the tourists.

13
0:01:46.150000-->0:01:51.310000
 It's lovely then, but when in the summer, it's like, oh, not so great. Yeah.

14
0:01:57.500000-->0:02:13.860000
 Oh, right. Lovely. Yeah. Yeah.

15
0:02:13.860000-->0:02:19.220000
 Are you a student? What are you studying?

16
0:02:19.220000-->0:02:26.060000
 Oh, right. Oh, well, that's good. You should get a good job with that, shouldn't you?

17
0:02:54.230000-->0:02:54.370000
 It's the way to go, isn't it?

18
0:02:54.370000-->0:02:55.610000
 What do you think of AI?

19
0:02:56.860000-->0:02:59.960000
 Well, I've just retired. I retired a bit early.

20
0:02:59.960000-->0:03:02.380000
 Yeah, a bit early, because I've got sort of, like...

21
0:03:02.380000-->0:03:06
 As I say, my knees are bad, and I've got problems with other things.

22
0:03:06-->0:03:09.220000
 So I thought, no, stuff it. I've done enough time working.

23
0:03:09.220000-->0:03:10.760000
 Spend time for me now.

24
0:03:10.760000-->0:03:14.210000
 Oh, thank you.

25
0:03:14.950000-->0:03:16.090000
 Yeah.

26
0:03:20.760000-->0:03:21.120000
 Yeah.

27
0:03:21.120000-->0:03:25.980000
 Well, I've done all sorts. I used to have my own jeweller's shop.

28
0:03:25.980000-->0:03:27.620000
 I've worked in banking.

29
0:03:27.800000-->0:03:31.480000
 And the last sort of few years, I've done, like...

30
0:03:31.480000-->0:03:35.640000
 I've been a chef, only in, like, a small cafe, not a big grand chef or anything.

31
0:03:39.780000-->0:03:39.840000
 But, you know...

32
0:03:39.840000-->0:03:41.780000
 So I thought, no, that's it. Can't do any more.

33
0:03:41.780000-->0:03:43.740000
 So that's what's neck of my knees.

34
0:03:43.800000-->0:03:46.160000
 But, yeah.

35
0:04:02.480000-->0:04:02.500000
 Yeah.

36
0:04:02.500000-->0:04:02.800000
 No.

37
0:04:02.800000-->0:04:04.660000
 I'd say don't.

38
0:04:05.500000-->0:04:08.480000
 Don't do it. Do it for yourself.
