 Hi, how are you? Hi, I'm glad to hear your audio working. My audio wasn't working with

1
0:00:18.400000-->0:00:28.630000
 the first guy and I thought it was something at my end, but seems to be sorted now. Yeah.

2
0:00:28.630000-->0:00:37.110000
 Are you over in England? Yeah. London? Yeah. Everyone I've been talking to so far has been

3
0:00:37.110000-->0:00:56.050000
 in London. I'm in Belfast in Ireland. Yeah. In London, yeah. Is it cold? It's absolutely

4
0:00:56.050000-->0:01:02.790000
 freezing and it's starting to snow at the minute. It's a lot of sleet, so it is. Yeah.

5
0:01:02.790000-->0:01:07.890000
 But I'm not sure if it's going to lie. I think it's the rain for like the next two weeks

6
0:01:07.890000-->0:01:24.180000
 or something. It's just rotten at the minute. Is yours bad? No. Yeah. Oh, thank God. Roll

7
0:01:24.180000-->0:01:46.210000
 on summer. Yeah. I know. I know. Have you any holidays planned? Not yet. No. Oh, very

8
0:01:46.210000-->0:01:55.830000
 good. Lovely. I hate going swimming in the winter. I find it such an ordeal, like getting

9
0:01:55.830000-->0:02:01.310000
 changed and running from the pool to the changing rooms. It's so cold. I can think of nothing

10
0:02:01.550000-->0:02:20.400000
 worse. Do you? Do you do the ice water baths? No. Not that bad. I know. We went to the...

11
0:02:24.480000-->0:02:33.680000
 Do you? I know. We went to the beach on Saturday just for a walk along and it's all these people

12
0:02:33.680000-->0:02:39.340000
 that do know the cold water swimming like all winter and like it was freezing windy

13
0:02:39.340000-->0:02:44.280000
 and raining and they were coming out of the sea and their skin was literally pure red

14
0:02:44.280000-->0:02:49.420000
 with the cold. I don't know. It couldn't be good. Yeah. It could not be good for your

15
0:02:49.420000-->0:03:21.990000
 heart. Really? Oh, God. No. I know. Do you go all the time swimming? Yeah. Do you? It's

16
0:03:21.990000-->0:03:46.970000
 so good for you but isn't it? Who do you support? What team do you support? Okay. Yeah. Oh,

17
0:03:46.970000-->0:03:54.790000
 very good. My son, he has followed Ronaldo from like Real Madrid to Juventus to Man

18
0:03:54.790000-->0:04:00.510000
 United and he supported Liverpool and the minute Ronaldo went to Man United, he left

19
0:04:00.510000-->0:04:02.890000
 Liverpool. He's only...
