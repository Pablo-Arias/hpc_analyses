 Hi! Um, can you see me okay? How's everything going? Great. Yeah, that's perfect. Um, what's

1
0:00:22.900000-->0:00:39.840000
 your name? I'm quite bored at the moment to be honest. What about you? Oh yeah, I was

2
0:00:39.840000-->0:01:01.050000
 actually washing my clothes. My name is Merve. It's a Turkish name. Merve. Like Turkey. I came a

3
0:01:01.050000-->0:01:29.850000
 long way. What's your name? Oh yeah? And do you live in the UK? So what do you do? Are you a student? Yeah, me too. So you're

4
0:01:29.850000-->0:01:56.700000
 here for like, just for studies or? Yeah, same. I'm the same, I live in Exeter and I'm a student here for postgraduate and it's just been six months. Yeah, it's, it's. Oh, and what grade are you? A year in second year.

0:02:05.550000-->0:02:27.890000
 What is it again? What's your department? Oh. I haven't been to any places in the UK yet, so my map in my head is definitely all messed up, but I'm sure it's not so far away.

0:02:27.890000-->0:03:00.390000
 Um, for fun, I try to go out, but Exeter is not great, I would say. It's just, you know, a few clubs, just pubs. I lived in Istanbul, so I do like clubbing, but not like here. I lived in Istanbul, so it's just like a village for me at the moment, because Exeter is so small, um, but it's very nice.

7
0:03:00.390000-->0:03:28.100000
 It's very green, so I usually go for runs and just, you know, walk around when the weather is not rainy. It's just not very fun at the moment. Hmm? I don't, but I like doing exercise like five times a day. Yeah, I do work out very often. You do anything?

8
0:03:32.680000-->0:03:32.980000
 No.

9
0:03:46.380000-->0:03:49.740000
 Yeah, me too. Studies are brutal.

10
0:03:52.160000-->0:04:01.300000
 Exactly. Oh, did you have any opportunity to go somewhere during the winter break, Christmas break?

11
0:04:03.650000-->0:04:08.970000
 No. Me neither. I just went off to Scotland and then was...
