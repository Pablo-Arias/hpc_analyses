 Hello, how are you? Yeah, good, thank you. I've just come off a call speaking. Oh, you

1
0:00:22.920000-->0:00:47.690000
 can, good. Oh, no. Oh, no. So you just sat there for four minutes in silence. Oh, no.

2
0:00:49.590000-->0:00:57.010000
 I'm in Preston. So surprisingly, the person I've just spoke with is from Preston as well,

3
0:00:57.010000-->0:01:03.750000
 which is so weird. So I wonder if they've grouped us. Whereabouts are you from? Okay,

4
0:01:03.750000-->0:01:11.040000
 so they've not grouped us on like similar locations at all then. Yeah, it must be, that's

5
0:01:11.040000-->0:01:27.910000
 strange. Is it free to play with you as well? It's ice cold in here. Oh, God. Yeah, me too.

6
0:01:27.910000-->0:01:31.770000
 I mean, I try not to put it on too much if I'm at home on my own, just because there's

7
0:01:31.770000-->0:01:35.130000
 no point heating a whole house. But today I've broken that rule, that heating's going

8
0:01:35.130000-->0:01:42.870000
 on just for me. No, no kids, just me and my little dog and then my boyfriend. Yeah,

9
0:01:42.870000-->0:01:59.270000
 what about you? There's no point. Oh, yeah, that's a good idea, actually. I might grab

10
0:01:59.270000-->0:02:05.350000
 one as well. How old is your little girl? Is she in school now then? Oh, so she's in

11
0:02:05.350000-->0:02:19.320000
 school now. Oh, God. Yeah, in September. Yeah, they grow up quickly, girls, don't they? I've

12
0:02:19.320000-->0:02:25.100000
 got, I think she's 15, 15-year-old niece, and she's grown up so quickly the past few

13
0:02:25.100000-->0:02:33.680000
 years, like as soon as she went to high school, different person. So be prepared. My sister's

14
0:02:33.680000-->0:02:42.690000
 daughter, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, literally. I mean, I can even see it from her, just like

15
0:02:42.690000-->0:02:48.050000
 her text to me and what she's like. But it's funny because my boyfriend's got four brothers,

16
0:02:49.310000-->0:03:10.500000
 and they're so different, like girls and boys are so different. Yeah, I think, do you know

17
0:03:10.500000-->0:03:17.360000
 what? Everyone who's got a girl says the exact same thing. But then if I was to choose, like

18
0:03:17.360000-->0:03:23
 if I was going to have kids, I'd want a girl. So I don't know why. I don't know, I just

19
0:03:23-->0:03:52.420000
 want a little best friend. Yeah, we're not cool enough for them anymore. That's so funny.

20
0:03:53.400000-->0:04:03.950000
 Oh, bless her. You're already starting to embarrass her. Lovely to meet you anyway in

21
0:04:03.950000-->0:04:05.310000
 case we get cut off any time.
