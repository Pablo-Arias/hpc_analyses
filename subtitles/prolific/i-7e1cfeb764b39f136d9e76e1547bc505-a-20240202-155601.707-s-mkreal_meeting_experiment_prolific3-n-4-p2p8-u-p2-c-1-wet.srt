0:00:05.050000-->0:00:17.300000
 Hi. Hiya. Hiya, I can hear you. Can you hear me okay?

1
0:00:17.300000-->0:00:26.400000
 Oh, you're so good.

2
0:00:28.300000-->0:00:36.660000
 Ah, yes I am actually. That was a lucky guess.

3
0:00:36.660000-->0:00:39.100000
 Ah, classics. How did you know?

4
0:00:41.250000-->0:00:44.190000
 Age. It was a good guess.

5
0:00:44.850000-->0:00:47.300000
 Um, yeah, I'm finishing up my masters right now.

6
0:00:47.300000-->0:00:50.420000
 Oh, I have no idea.

7
0:00:50.420000-->0:00:56.760000
 I did the masters kind of hoping it would give me a better idea of what I'm going to do in the future,

8
0:00:56.760000-->0:01:01.700000
 but I'm coming to the end of it with no better answers to give to any of my family or anything.

9
0:01:01.700000-->0:01:02.880000
 So that's fun.

10
0:01:02.900000-->0:01:13
 It is, but one, it terrifies me, and two, yesterday during my seminar,

11
0:01:13-->0:01:14.880000
 my professor was warning all of us.

12
0:01:14.880000-->0:01:18.820000
 She was saying, do not do a PhD, no matter what you do, do not do it.

13
0:01:18.820000-->0:01:21.700000
 And I was shocked coming from a professor to be saying that.

14
0:01:21.700000-->0:01:25.720000
 She was saying that it's just not worth working in academia anymore,

15
0:01:25.720000-->0:01:28.660000
 like the pay is awful, you're constantly stressed out.

16
0:01:28.660000-->0:01:32.760000
 She was like, go get a job and come back much, much later.

17
0:01:32.760000-->0:01:36.680000
 I was like, I respect being honest actually, like I really respect her.

18
0:01:36.680000-->0:01:39.880000
 She was like, I refuse to lie to any of my students anymore about it,

19
0:01:39.880000-->0:01:41.900000
 and I was really surprised by that.

20
0:01:47.340000-->0:01:57.010000
 Yes, honestly.

21
0:02:05.150000-->0:02:06.410000
 Yeah, absolutely.

22
0:02:06.410000-->0:02:10.570000
 She was saying that both her and her husband have PhDs and they both are in academia,

23
0:02:10.570000-->0:02:15.050000
 and their daughter has seen them just stressed 24-7,

24
0:02:15.050000-->0:02:17.090000
 and she apparently just said, nope, I'm not doing it,

25
0:02:17.090000-->0:02:20.710000
 not touching further education, passing undergrad, which, fair, yeah.

26
0:02:20.710000-->0:02:24.680000
 I completely understand that, yeah.

27
0:02:25-->0:02:27.440000
 What do you do, if you don't mind me asking?

28
0:02:28.360000-->0:02:29.300000
 Oh, okay, nice.

29
0:02:30.550000-->0:02:31.370000
 Oh, that's nice.

30
0:02:31.550000-->0:02:32.930000
 Have you been fighting it?

31
0:02:36.200000-->0:02:41.630000
 Oh, my gosh.

32
0:02:41.950000-->0:02:46.450000
 That's so exciting.

33
0:02:55.880000-->0:02:55.940000
 Oh, my gosh.

34
0:02:59.380000-->0:02:59.420000
 That's amazing.

35
0:02:59.420000-->0:03:04.050000
 Oh, that's so exciting.

36
0:03:08.840000-->0:03:10.180000
 Do you have anywhere else you really want to go now?

37
0:03:12.080000-->0:03:12.140000
 The other time?

38
0:03:25.520000-->0:03:25.600000
 That would be amazing.

39
0:03:25.600000-->0:03:27.340000
 What's your favourite place?

40
0:03:29.640000-->0:03:29.980000
 Oh, really?

41
0:03:32.080000-->0:03:32.160000
 Where did you go?

42
0:03:40.500000-->0:03:40.640000
 Wow, you're so well-travelled.

43
0:03:45.410000-->0:03:45.490000
 That sounds honestly amazing.

44
0:03:47.110000-->0:03:47.450000
 I haven't really travelled.

45
0:03:48.650000-->0:03:49.450000
 I haven't really travelled much.

46
0:03:49.450000-->0:03:54.430000
 I kind of went straight from high school to uni,

47
0:03:54.430000-->0:03:59.430000
 and then I had COVID in the middle, so that kind of put, yeah.

48
0:03:59.430000-->0:04:02.350000
 Yeah, they put a halt to any of my plans,

49
0:04:02.350000-->0:04:05.470000
 but hopefully maybe after the Master's, give myself a little break.
