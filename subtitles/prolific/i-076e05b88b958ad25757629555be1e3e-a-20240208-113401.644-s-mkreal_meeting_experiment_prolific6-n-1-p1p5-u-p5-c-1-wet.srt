 Hi, hello. Did you also wait for 50 hours? What is this? I was just

1
0:00:22.090000-->0:00:25.690000
 Yeah, I was just about to cancel it because I was like well

2
0:00:25.690000-->0:00:30.890000
 They said 15 minutes and then another five minutes here another five minutes there. It's just taking way too long

3
0:00:35.080000-->0:00:44.760000
 How's it going? Oh?

4
0:00:44.760000-->0:00:46.620000
 Yeah, I know it's

5
0:00:46.620000-->0:00:51.840000
 You want you want to hope for the spring, but it's just keeps on getting worse and worse and worse

6
0:00:56.350000-->0:01:01.790000
 No, I'm in London, so it's like we've had maybe I

7
0:01:02.450000-->0:01:06.900000
 Don't know about three minutes of snow a couple of weeks ago

8
0:01:06.900000-->0:01:12.140000
 It didn't even stay but everyone you know it did you know how people are it's like oh my god snow

9
0:01:12.140000-->0:01:15.580000
 Everyone's filming, and I'm like it's not even real snow. It's just like

10
0:01:16.300000-->0:01:17.790000
 spring whatever

11
0:01:23.980000-->0:01:24.440000
 Hmm

12
0:01:40.090000-->0:01:41.990000
 But it's probably pretty as well though no

13
0:01:47.420000-->0:01:52.160000
 Because I'm originally from Russia, so I do miss the snow sometimes

14
0:01:55.150000-->0:02:00.350000
 We do get a lot of snow. I mean with it with the global warming. It's a bit different now

15
0:02:00.350000-->0:02:05.690000
 I think well I haven't been home for a while for obvious reasons, but in the winter

16
0:02:05.690000-->0:02:12.250000
 It's now it's a bit more like UK weather it like gets maybe to like minus five

17
0:02:12.250000-->0:02:16.190000
 In the coldest days and then most of the time. It's just like five eight

18
0:02:16.510000-->0:02:33.640000
 Yeah, when I was a kid we we used to have like a countryside house

19
0:02:33.640000-->0:02:39.660000
 And that would happen and my dad absolutely hated it because it's like you can't get through you need to clear all that up and

20
0:02:39.660000-->0:02:44.760000
 Like you need the tractor to actually clean it. It's like one man cannot really

21
0:02:47.080000-->0:02:51.550000
 Do that I know good old

22
0:02:51.550000-->0:02:59.950000
 No, it's you know we're like and I remember as a kid

23
0:03:02.070000-->0:03:04.310000
 We were allowed not to come to school allowed

24
0:03:04.310000-->0:03:10.290000
 So it's not like you know the school gets closed off. It's like we're allowed to not go if it's minus 30

25
0:03:14.440000-->0:03:17.300000
 Yeah, so it's like you know minus 29 hell no wake up go to school

26
0:03:20.900000-->0:03:21.580000
 It's like nobody cares

27
0:03:22.120000-->0:03:30.380000
 Yeah, it surprises me in the UK. It's like you know the second. There is a little bit heavier rain

28
0:03:30.380000-->0:03:35.020000
 It's like oh, no all the trains stop everything stops, and I'm like when you were building

29
0:03:37.100000-->0:03:39.380000
 Did you not know that it rains in the UK you know it's a thing

30
0:03:39.380000-->0:03:47.760000
 It's you know I that's one thing I cannot understand. It's like the transport is so unreliable here

31
0:04:01.650000-->0:04:01.710000
 Yeah, I know

32
0:04:03.820000-->0:04:04.300000
 Well, it was nice to meet you. I think we've

33
0:04:04.320000-->0:04:07.590000
 They're gonna cut us off in a second
