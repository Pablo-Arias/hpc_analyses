 Hello. How are you? Good. Good. I can hear you a little muffled, but I think it will be all right.

1
0:00:25.600000-->0:00:31.480000
 It's all right. How have your past conversation gone?

2
0:00:32.400000-->0:01:00.050000
 Mm-hmm. Is this number? Yes. Oh, interesting. Well, you've had another one.

3
0:01:04.400000-->0:01:13.230000
 From the States, from New York. I'm based in London for a bit of time now.

4
0:01:14.800000-->0:01:26.390000
 Mm-hmm. How about you? Oh, I love it. I love it. It's been a very positive move for me in many aspects.

5
0:01:27.250000-->0:01:38.930000
 Yes. How about you? Oh, gosh. I got laid off. I was part of the tech layoffs.

6
0:01:38.950000-->0:01:47.890000
 I was working for a very, very big software company, and it's the economy now.

7
0:01:48.950000-->0:02:03.380000
 So that happened, and I have just been figuring things out, which is why I ended up on Prolific, actually, in the meantime, while I'm applying for new jobs.

8
0:02:03.400000-->0:02:15.400000
 But I have a very, very kind and supportive partner as well. So I am lucky in that sense that I have incredible support around me.

9
0:02:15.400000-->0:02:22.220000
 But, yeah, just excited to start another project and go back to work.

10
0:02:25.100000-->0:02:35.940000
 Yeah, well, it's just, you know, it's the times.

11
0:02:36.300000-->0:02:41.560000
 Yeah. Whereabouts are you?

12
0:02:45.150000-->0:02:49.970000
 Fantastic. How is the weather?

13
0:02:53.180000-->0:02:56.830000
 Yeah. Yes.

14
0:02:59.050000-->0:03:09.080000
 Yeah, well, so it's been a lovely, lovely weekend. It was so sunny. I was up in the Cotswolds, and it was absolutely gorgeous.

15
0:03:11.570000-->0:03:11.750000
 Yeah.

16
0:03:12.250000-->0:03:17.990000
 Hopefully the weather. Yes, yes, yes.

17
0:03:19.650000-->0:03:25.030000
 Yeah, it's fantastic. I was just up for a wedding.

18
0:03:27.660000-->0:03:33.820000
 Yeah, so a couple of our friends got married there, and it was just really beautiful, beautiful time.

19
0:03:34.400000-->0:03:37.960000
 Yeah, for February, especially, it was sunny and 13 degrees.

20
0:03:40.190000-->0:03:40.590000
 Mm hmm.

21
0:03:43.150000-->0:03:51.760000
 I'm not sure yet. I should assume so, but I've been told just to keep my calendar and my diary empty.

22
0:03:52.460000-->0:03:52.760000
 Mm hmm.

23
0:03:54.050000-->0:03:56.770000
 Yes. What about you?
