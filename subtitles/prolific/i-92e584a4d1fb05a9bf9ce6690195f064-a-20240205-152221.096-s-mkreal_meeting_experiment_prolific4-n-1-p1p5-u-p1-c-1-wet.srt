0:00:34.650000-->0:00:56.830000
 Oh, you mean a British person, okay, it's a bit similar to that, a British boyfriend

1
0:00:56.830000-->0:00:57.390000
 as well.

2
0:00:57.530000-->0:01:12.330000
 Actually, I got a scholarship and I am doing my Master's at the moment, apart from studies,

3
0:01:12.330000-->0:01:21.490000
 I also have a British boyfriend and I think it's just, you know, meant to be, so I'm here.

4
0:01:21.810000-->0:01:28.610000
 It wasn't planned, but I'm here for almost like six months now and it's been great, actually.

5
0:01:29.590000-->0:01:31.350000
 Have you ever wanted to exit there?

6
0:01:37.810000-->0:01:38.510000
 Oh, really?

7
0:01:43.810000-->0:01:44.870000
 Oh, really?

8
0:01:45.810000-->0:01:48.090000
 Oh, that's great.

9
0:01:48.090000-->0:01:53.750000
 I mean, that's such a coincidence when you both have a scholarship and you're talking

10
0:01:53.750000-->0:01:54.230000
 to each other.

11
0:01:55.810000-->0:01:58.590000
 And where do you live right now?

12
0:02:05.810000-->0:02:09.270000
 Is it like living in Brantford?

13
0:02:15.810000-->0:02:16.330000
 Hmm.

14
0:02:18.810000-->0:02:19.930000
 Hmm.

15
0:02:23.810000-->0:02:31.390000
 I think I would say the same thing for Exeter to be honest, it's very green and small, but

16
0:02:31.390000-->0:02:37.330000
 it's very close to Bristol, so if you've got something to do, you know, you can go there

17
0:02:37.330000-->0:02:39.890000
 and it's just a very big city.

18
0:02:39.890000-->0:02:48.430000
 But Exeter is always, frankly to me, it's been really easy for me to adapt and I quite

19
0:02:48.430000-->0:02:54.350000
 like living here because you can walk everywhere and it's just so nice to be on the trees.

20
0:02:54.350000-->0:02:57.970000
 I just really, really like it to be honest.

21
0:02:57.970000-->0:03:04.210000
 I mean, the weather is nice, it's grey at the moment, but it's usually warmer than the

22
0:03:04.210000-->0:03:05.350000
 other parts of the UK.

23
0:03:09.810000-->0:03:10.510000
 Hmm.

24
0:03:16.810000-->0:03:19.810000
 I am studying, teaching English.

25
0:03:22.350000-->0:03:22.930000
 Hmm.

26
0:03:28.310000-->0:03:28.930000
 Yeah.

27
0:03:29.810000-->0:03:42.510000
 I actually work as an English lecturer in Turkey, but since I'm trying to change my

28
0:03:42.810000-->0:03:49.250000
 life over here, I don't know what I'm going to do here, but I think I might even do something

29
0:03:50.790000-->0:03:50.810000
 else.

30
0:03:50.810000-->0:03:57.370000
 I'm just trying to figure out what I might plan for the future, but I quite enjoy it.

31
0:03:57.370000-->0:04:00.130000
 It's something I've been doing for 10 years.

32
0:04:01.070000-->0:04:01.570000
 Hmm.

33
0:04:01.810000-->0:04:08.190000
 It's hard to find a job because you're not a native speaker and you're teaching English.

34
0:04:08.190000-->0:04:09.970000
 So, this is it.
