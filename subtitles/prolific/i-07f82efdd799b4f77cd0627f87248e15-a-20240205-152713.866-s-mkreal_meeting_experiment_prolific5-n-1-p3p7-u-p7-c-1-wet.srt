0:00:06.150000-->0:00:27.860000
 Hi. Yeah, I can see you and hear you. Can you hear and see me? Yeah, me neither. Yeah,

1
0:00:28.180000-->0:00:34.580000
 I think it's just like, I guess they're kind of analysing, like introducing, I don't know

2
0:00:34.580000-->0:00:45.270000
 how you would meet someone. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm based in London. I've been here for like

3
0:00:45.270000-->0:00:52.920000
 11, 12 years, I think. Yeah, what about you? Okay, cool. You don't sound like you're from

4
0:00:52.920000-->0:01:08.120000
 Manchester. American. All right. Very funny. How long have you been living in Manchester

5
0:01:08.120000-->0:01:22.060000
 for? Oh, cool. Nice. You must look at them. Yeah, it's really nice. I've got quite a few

6
0:01:22.060000-->0:01:26.880000
 friends who live up in Manchester actually. Yeah, it's a cool place. It's cool. Quite a few of my

7
0:01:26.880000-->0:01:31.320000
 friends went to uni. Yeah, a lot of my friends went to uni there. So I would go up and visit

8
0:01:31.320000-->0:01:36.980000
 them. And some people who I used to work with live in Manchester. So I've been up for their

9
0:01:36.980000-->0:01:44.020000
 wedding. Yeah, it's a cool place. It's like, I don't know, it's annoying because London is like

10
0:01:44.020000-->0:01:50.520000
 the only city in the area, really. Whereas Manchester, I like that you've, I don't know,

11
0:01:50.520000-->0:01:54.300000
 it's like a smaller town, but it's so far from where I'm from that it wouldn't make any sense

12
0:01:54.300000-->0:02:23.340000
 moving there. But I really like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, London's pretty bad for that.

13
0:02:23.340000-->0:02:30
 The other day, all the trains were cancelled. And I couldn't get into work. But I couldn't

14
0:02:30-->0:02:33.940000
 like drive my car because you just can't drive into London. And I was like, it's only five

15
0:02:33.940000-->0:02:43.460000
 miles away, but I can't even drive. Like it's crazy. I just work from home. There's no choice.

16
0:02:43.460000-->0:02:49.460000
 There's no choice. Yeah. So yeah, London is very different. I suppose you get you get tired of it

17
0:02:49.460000-->0:03:00.450000
 sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you do? You're a student? Oh, cool. What kind of sales? Oh,

18
0:03:00.450000-->0:03:13.140000
 nice. Okay. I work in like politics advisory. Yeah, yeah, it's busy, busy time. Yeah. So it's

19
0:03:13.140000-->0:03:52.370000
 interesting. How did you get into sales? Cool. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah. Oh,

20
0:03:52.370000-->0:04:09.060000
 where did you go? That sounds amazing. Oh, I'm so jealous. I'd love to have all the work.
