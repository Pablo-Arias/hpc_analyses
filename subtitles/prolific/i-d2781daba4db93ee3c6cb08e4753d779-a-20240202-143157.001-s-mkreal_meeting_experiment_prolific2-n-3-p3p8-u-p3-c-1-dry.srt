 Hi! I went to grab water, it was still connecting. I'm Naima, it's good to meet you. Neat, I'm

1
0:00:31.270000-->0:00:53.320000
 well, from Canada, but I live in Manchester now. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. My husband. Yeah. Ooh,

2
0:00:54.320000-->0:01:03.240000
 online. But yeah, so we had initially met online and then we, like he visited Canada

3
0:01:03.240000-->0:01:08.200000
 quite a few times and then we decided to take the leap and being here just made sense for

4
0:01:08.200000-->0:01:17.370000
 us. So here we are. I miss my family. I do miss aspects of Canada for sure, but mostly

5
0:01:17.370000-->0:01:34.940000
 my family, I'd say. Oh, for sure. I love it here. I, do you know what? It's actually interesting.

6
0:01:34.940000-->0:01:39.420000
 I don't think that there's that much of a difference. I think, um, between Canada and

7
0:01:39.420000-->0:01:45.440000
 England there's, um, as, as far as culture, it's very similar. We obviously speak the

8
0:01:45.440000-->0:01:50.580000
 same language. Um, and you know, the people are very similar. I would say, especially

9
0:01:50.580000-->0:02:16.760000
 being up North, everybody's very kind. Everybody's welcoming. It's great. Yeah. Oh, wow. No way.

10
0:02:23.400000-->0:02:38.840000
 Okay. That's quite close to where I am. I, I'm in Salford so far. Yeah. Right. And how

11
0:02:38.840000-->0:03:08.560000
 did you like it? Right. Oh, that's so sweet. Yeah, that's great. When did you retire? Not

12
0:03:08.560000-->0:03:14.360000
 at the moment. I actually have an interview on Tuesday and another one on Wednesday of

13
0:03:14.360000-->0:03:24.450000
 next week. So, oh, thank you. What about you? How's retirement treating you? How's

14
0:03:24.450000-->0:04:01.710000
 retirement treating you? Yeah. Do you get bored? Do you get bored? Yeah. Right. Oh,

15
0:04:01.710000-->0:04:06.050000
 that's lovely. I imagine I would be too. I look forward to all the time.
