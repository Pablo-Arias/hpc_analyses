 Hello! My name's Leah, what's your name?

1
0:00:18.150000-->0:00:23.110000
 And you, and you. Have you ever done a study like this before?

2
0:00:27-->0:00:36.100000
 This is really random. No, no, no. I've done ones on video where you have to interact with people to solve puzzles,

3
0:00:36.100000-->0:00:40.280000
 but never anything like this where you have to talk with somebody.

4
0:00:40.340000-->0:00:42.200000
 Four minutes is quite a long time.

5
0:00:47.050000-->0:00:55.990000
 It was really good. It was, there were a group of four of you, and one of you was assigned a leadership role,

6
0:00:55.990000-->0:01:00.990000
 and you had to do, you had to delegate the roles to other people.

7
0:01:00.990000-->0:01:08.350000
 So there was a question, someone who had to tick on questions to go through them,

8
0:01:08.350000-->0:01:11.210000
 someone who then had to input the answers, and you all had to work together.

9
0:01:11.210000-->0:01:17.650000
 And it was, you basically had to work out the answer to these maths puzzles, which was,

10
0:01:17.650000-->0:01:20.410000
 I'm hopeless at maths, so it was quite intimidating.

11
0:01:23.050000-->0:01:29.120000
 So where, it was, it was good fun. But yeah, this is, this is completely different.

12
0:01:29.120000-->0:01:33.200000
 Yeah, so whereabouts are you in the world right now?

13
0:01:35.710000-->0:01:38.670000
 Oh, lovely. I'm down in Suffolk.

14
0:01:39.250000-->0:02:07.340000
 Do you like Manchester? Which part of Canada? Near Toronto, or?

15
0:02:07.340000-->0:02:24.130000
 Okay. I think I have heard of it. Is it in Alberta? Yes? There we go.

16
0:02:25.550000-->0:02:30.380000
 No, do you prefer the UK to Canada?

17
0:02:34.550000-->0:02:59.960000
 Really? Oh my gosh. It's, I've got some friends in Toronto, they've just bought a place,

18
0:02:59.960000-->0:03:06.240000
 and they were trying to explain to me the other day that their mortgage has basically gone up so much

19
0:03:06.240000-->0:03:11.570000
 that it's now worth more than the value of their house. So they're overpaying.

20
0:03:29.560000-->0:03:50.490000
 Yeah. Impossible. Absolutely impossible. I mean, it's like, we don't have the space.

21
0:03:50.490000-->0:03:56.570000
 And then if there is the space, the cost of the land is just like, bonkers expensive.

22
0:03:56.570000-->0:04:01.670000
 It is, it is. And then of course the cost of the build and price of materials are going up.

23
0:04:03.210000-->0:04:07.570000
 So it is so hard. Yeah, it's hard. But I mean, yeah.
