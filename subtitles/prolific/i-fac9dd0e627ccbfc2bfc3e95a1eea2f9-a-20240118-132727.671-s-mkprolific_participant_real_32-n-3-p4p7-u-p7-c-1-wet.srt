 Hello, I'm good thank you, how are you?

1
0:00:19.950000-->0:00:26.450000
 It's quite strange isn't it, you get to know people and then as soon as that 15 seconds

2
0:00:26.450000-->0:00:29.950000
 comes on you're like mid-conversation then it's just never see that person ever again.

3
0:00:38.740000-->0:00:45.620000
 Me too actually, yeah, and I did, the first girl I spoke to she was really local to where

4
0:00:45.620000-->0:00:50.180000
 I live, but then the second girl I spoke to was right at the top of the country, I guess

5
0:00:50.180000-->0:00:54.700000
 we're all in the UK, that's all I can really like conclude about it as all.

6
0:00:58.700000-->0:01:09
 Oh okay, yeah so the girl I just spoke to is from Glasgow, yeah she was saying how freezing

7
0:01:09-->0:01:20.870000
 she is, she was sat with a hot water bottle, have you, wow, oh gosh yeah because we had

8
0:01:20.870000-->0:01:28.050000
 a little, yeah but just not nice to be outside in, yeah we had a little bit of snow a few

9
0:01:28.050000-->0:01:33.890000
 days ago for one day and everything was cancelled and all the schools were shut and because

10
0:01:33.890000-->0:01:52.600000
 we can't cope with the weather at all can we, yeah, ah so what's your plans for the

11
0:01:52.600000-->0:01:55.620000
 rest of the day then, will you go out in the snow at all or will you just stay in and stay

12
0:01:55.620000-->0:01:55.920000
 warm?

13
0:01:57.950000-->0:02:06.690000
 Oh, ah, oh I bet they do, what dogs have you got?

14
0:02:06.690000-->0:02:20.440000
 I've got one of my own as well, cute, ah, do you know what that's really interesting

15
0:02:20.440000-->0:02:24.760000
 I know we don't have long but could you tell me about what that was like when you brought

16
0:02:24.760000-->0:02:28.740000
 the puppy because I've got a four-year-old Labrador and I'm desperate to get another

17
0:02:28.740000-->0:02:32.400000
 but I'm so scared on what they're going to be like together, did you find it okay when

18
0:02:32.400000-->0:02:32.920000
 you got a puppy?

19
0:02:40.050000-->0:03:26.650000
 Right, oh it's a big jump from one to two, yeah, oh no he's got loads of energy, oh but

20
0:03:26.650000-->0:03:30.390000
 they grow up so quickly don't they, puppies do like they're literally a puppy for like

21
0:03:30.390000-->0:03:38.990000
 a second and then they're fully grown, oh yeah, well I spoke to someone who'd done it

22
0:03:38.990000-->0:03:42.470000
 and they said you already go out on a walk every day and you feed your dog every day

23
0:03:42.470000-->0:03:47.310000
 and it's just a case of grabbing another collar and a lead, grabbing another bowl and just

24
0:03:47.310000-->0:03:51.370000
 doing everything you're doing just that second time, so okay you've convinced me I'll go

25
0:03:51.370000-->0:03:59.560000
 buy another dog, oh yeah and the insurance and everything but they're worth it,

26
0:04:00.520000-->0:04:09.860000
 nice, good, yeah like little brothers, yeah nice to meet you anyway it might end as soon.
