 Hello. Hi, how are you? Not too bad, thank you. I just had a knee replacement five weeks

1
0:00:23.610000-->0:00:36.890000
 ago, so I'm at home recovering from that. It hurts, but it's not as bad as it was before,

2
0:00:37.510000-->0:00:48.770000
 so that's one good thing. Yeah, it's not a pleasant. Sorry? I think with the cold, yeah,

3
0:00:48.770000-->0:00:54.010000
 it's worse. I think it gets into the bone a little bit, but I'm five weeks into recovery

4
0:00:54.010000-->0:01:02.610000
 now, so we're getting there. Yeah. What do you do? Are you at university or? Yes, yeah.

5
0:01:05.200000-->0:01:15.740000
 You're studying? Oh, very good. Oh, very good. My son's up in the youngest one. The other

6
0:01:15.740000-->0:01:23.360000
 two are older now. Edge Hill. So he's doing teaching there. Yeah, Edge Hill University.

7
0:01:23.360000-->0:01:37.100000
 Don't know if you've heard of it. Oh, we've frozen. Are you back? Yeah. So he's doing

8
0:01:37.100000-->0:01:45.310000
 a teaching degree up there. He's in his last few months of that now. He wants to teach,

9
0:01:45.310000-->0:01:54.770000
 yeah. He wants to go to Japan, I think, teaching Japan. He only teaches the younger, you know,

10
0:01:54.770000-->0:02:00.700000
 like below 11. I don't think he doesn't like the older ones, so it's more fun, isn't it?

11
0:02:00.700000-->0:02:28.230000
 Yeah. No. What year? What year are you in at university? What year? There's no year, right?

12
0:02:29.650000-->0:02:35.680000
 Oh, you don't get paid to do, you don't get student loan, do you, to do that? You have

13
0:02:35.680000-->0:02:48.990000
 to fund yourself. No. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I know. Yeah. I mean, we sent Matthew back last week.

14
0:02:50.650000-->0:03:04
 Yeah. What else do you do other than prolific then? A holiday. Oh, Christmas. I hated it.

15
0:03:04.140000-->0:03:15.400000
 I hate Christmas. Because I think if you're not religious, it's just all materialistic and

16
0:03:17.200000-->0:03:23.910000
 I don't enjoy it. We have all year round now, don't we? We have whatever we want.

17
0:03:24.650000-->0:03:29.510000
 So it used to be that you'd be, it'd be a special time. You'd have presents and it was,

18
0:03:29.510000-->0:03:34.930000
 you know, and my mum's dead as well. So my daughter lives in America. She's the main

19
0:03:34.930000-->0:03:41.090000
 Christmassy one. So no, I hate it. I hope you don't mind me saying, do you like Christmas?

20
0:03:52.450000-->0:04:03.620000
 Yeah. No, I'm sorry. Good luck with your future and I hope you get your degree and go on to do

21
0:04:03.620000-->0:04:07.480000
 good things. Good luck for the future.
