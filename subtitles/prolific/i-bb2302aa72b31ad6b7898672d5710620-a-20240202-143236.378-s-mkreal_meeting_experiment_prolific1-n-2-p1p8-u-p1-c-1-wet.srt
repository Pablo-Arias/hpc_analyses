 Hello? Hi, can you hear me okay? Yes I can. Yes. Thank you, how are you? I'm good. Oh no, I'm at home. Are you at work?

1
0:00:50.700000-->0:01:08.950000
 No. Yeah, this is very weird. I live in Medway in Kent. Oh, we're just supposed to chat.

2
0:01:09.750000-->0:01:30.390000
 Yeah, but where do you live? Where do you live? Oh, okay. I love Birmingham. Mostly

3
0:01:30.390000-->0:01:35.790000
 because I went to Leicester Uni and so it was easy to get to and I went there a lot.

4
0:01:39.350000-->0:01:53.600000
 Yeah. No. Are you? Yeah. Do you have any fun things that you like to do in Birmingham?

5
0:01:53.700000-->0:02:12.020000
 Okay. And you don't enjoy going to the museum? I really like the museum when I used to go

6
0:02:12.020000-->0:02:38.420000
 there. Yeah. No, that makes sense. But you will. I think Birmingham is quite good because

7
0:02:38.420000-->0:02:49.340000
 it's quite diverse and there are a lot of things to do and it's growing. Yeah. Yeah,

8
0:02:49.340000-->0:03:07.420000
 you will. But what made you move over to Birmingham? Okay. Yeah, my family had to do the same thing.

9
0:03:07.420000-->0:03:13.560000
 I'm from Zimbabwe and my dad got a job in America and so we moved to America and then

10
0:03:13.560000-->0:03:15.820000
 he got a job in the UK so we moved to the UK.
