 Such a weird experiment, right? It's just like, they're forcing us, it's too early, I haven't had my breakfast yet and they're forcing me to be sociable to people.

1
0:00:32.700000-->0:00:56.690000
 Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting experience. You get to meet a lot of people. I wonder, because I'm a psychologist myself, I wonder what exactly are they testing?

2
0:00:56.690000-->0:01:13.660000
 Like, how awkward is it? I don't know. There is one suspicious thing, I think that could be what they're testing, because can you see yourself on a screen?

3
0:01:13.660000-->0:01:27.050000
 I think that might be it, because it's so weird, you know how when you're on Zoom calls or Teams calls, I can't focus on what people are saying, you just keep on staring at yourself.

4
0:01:27.050000-->0:01:32.600000
 And now I can't see myself, so the only thing I can do is actually talk to people.

5
0:01:34-->0:01:48.840000
 Yeah. Did you say it was your first experiment? Of today or just in general on the website?

6
0:01:52.100000-->0:02:12.820000
 Oh, wow. That's pretty cool. So you've just started with Prolific. Nice. I've been on it for a couple of years. You get to do so many crazy things on it.

7
0:02:12.820000-->0:02:22.780000
 I mean, this is probably not the craziest I've done. There are some pretty boring ones, you know, when you just do like a questionnaire or something.

8
0:02:22.780000-->0:02:31.460000
 But there are some like this one, they don't really explain much. They're just like, here is a stranger, talk to a stranger.

9
0:02:35.700000-->0:03:07.720000
 At least you don't have to type things. I hate it when they're like, please write 500 words about how and you're just like, oh, my God, can you not?

10
0:03:07.720000-->0:03:15.030000
 And then you're trying to add more water to it, because you need to write a specific number of digits.

11
0:03:15.050000-->0:03:30.790000
 And you're just like, oh, my God, I really don't want to do it. And with this, at least, you know, you're just sitting here and just chatting to people. It's a little better.

12
0:03:38.400000-->0:04:00.210000
 Yeah. It's the evening where you are. It's a bit dark. You like being in the cave. Right. I see. It was very nice to meet you.
