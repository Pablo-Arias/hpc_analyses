 Hello? Oh, hi. Yes, I can hear you. I couldn't hear the guy before. I know. All picture and

1
0:00:33.310000-->0:00:42.180000
 no sound. Yeah. Are you the researcher or is this just like, oh, right. Is it just like

2
0:00:42.180000-->0:00:57.710000
 the chat with people? Oh, right. Oh, right. And then it's like speed dating, is it? Where

3
0:00:57.710000-->0:01:04.340000
 are you based? Oh, very good. I'm in Belfast and it's just starting to snow right now.

4
0:01:04.340000-->0:01:14.870000
 It's horrible weather here. Is yours bad? Rain? I know. Yeah, I know. It's rotten, isn't

5
0:01:14.870000-->0:01:24.400000
 it? Roll on springtime. I know. It's great, but you can see a change in the night, isn't

6
0:01:24.400000-->0:01:42.570000
 it? Getting the stretch of the evenings. Is that your cat? Oh, good. I know. I'm still

7
0:01:42.570000-->0:01:47.050000
 working from home at the minute. We do two days in the office and then three days at

8
0:01:47.050000-->0:01:58.990000
 home still since Covid. So it's great. No, nothing much. Just a couple of meetings later

9
0:01:58.990000-->0:02:05.250000
 with work and then just a guy coming to service the boiler. Nothing too exciting because then

10
0:02:05.250000-->0:02:14.440000
 I think it's ready to pack in. Oh, have you? I know, but that's one thing you can't live

11
0:02:14.440000-->0:02:29.350000
 without in this weather. I know. I know. I don't know how people cope without them. Oh,

12
0:02:29.350000-->0:02:42.870000
 my God. Are you a grandma? You don't look old enough. Have you? No way. Oh, my God.

13
0:02:42.870000-->0:02:52.690000
 And she doesn't use the tumble dryer, even with the kids. God. Oh, and the radiators,

14
0:02:52.690000-->0:03:02.950000
 does she dry it? Oh, right. OK. I know I wouldn't cope with that. We did that in our

15
0:03:02.950000-->0:03:08.370000
 last house and caused really bad damp and condensation. So I'm traumatized from that.

16
0:03:08.370000-->0:03:22.700000
 Yeah. Really bad. Oh, right. OK. And then the mold is terrible. But with children, with

17
0:03:22.700000-->0:03:33.400000
 their chest and colds and stuff, their respiratory systems, it's really bad. Yeah. Oh, my God.

18
0:03:33.400000-->0:03:39.120000
 She's all frozen. I wish I was more environmentally friendly. My carbon

19
0:03:39.120000-->0:03:55.610000
 footprint's probably shocking. I know. Something for an easy life. I know, definitely. Oh,

20
0:03:55.610000-->0:04:03.240000
 15 seconds. Yes, you too. Take care. Hope you get sorted. Bye.
