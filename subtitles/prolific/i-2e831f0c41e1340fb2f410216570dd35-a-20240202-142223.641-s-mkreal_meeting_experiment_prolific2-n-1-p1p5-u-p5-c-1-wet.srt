 Hi. I'm good, thank you. I'm just going to turn the sound up a little bit, I can't.

1
0:00:21.450000-->0:00:24.510000
 That's great, thank you. Yeah, how are you today?

2
0:00:30.100000-->0:00:36.820000
 Yeah, not too bad, thank you. Looking forward to the weekend and just chilling out. I've got some friends coming over, so.

3
0:00:36.820000-->0:00:49.800000
 Have you got any plans for the weekend? Yeah.

4
0:00:54-->0:00:58.840000
 I think sometimes it's really nice just to have no plans, isn't it, and no expectations.

5
0:01:04.750000-->0:01:09.890000
 Yeah. Yeah. What do you do?

6
0:01:17.960000-->0:01:25.110000
 I'm a counsellor, as in the therapeutic one rather than a political one.

7
0:01:28.550000-->0:01:42.790000
 Yeah, I do. It's very fulfilling, really. It's hard going, it can be quite gruelling, but I only work part-time now, so it's manageable, so yeah, not too bad.

8
0:01:43.650000-->0:01:44.890000
 Where are you based?

9
0:01:48.700000-->0:01:50.780000
 I'm in Leeds, yeah.

10
0:01:54.500000-->0:02:01.490000
 I came to Leeds University in 1989 and I've stayed, you know, just never went back.

11
0:02:02.550000-->0:02:21.510000
 I think the thing for me is that we've got the best of both worlds, so we've got all the city centre stuff and the convenience of that, but then you're 20 minutes the other way and we're in, you know, the Dales and beautiful countryside, so it really is, you know, you've got a great balance of the convenience and the countryside as well.

12
0:02:21.550000-->0:02:24.900000
 Have you always lived in Leeds?

13
0:02:41.190000-->0:02:41.650000
 Yeah.

14
0:02:43-->0:03:08.730000
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've got some friends who live in quite a remote area in the Dales and, you know, when I go it's absolutely idyllic, it's lovely, but then after a week I'm thinking, yeah, I'm ready not to have to drive 25 minutes to go and get a pint of milk, you know.

15
0:03:11.780000-->0:03:12.320000
 Yeah.

16
0:03:13.350000-->0:03:29.850000
 I have the dream that that would be an ideal place to live, but on the other hand I don't think it would because I'm disabled as well, so I'm sort of reliant on, like, convenience and you just don't get out in the sticks, so, yeah.

17
0:03:39.400000-->0:03:57.880000
 I think it depends on your life stage, isn't it, and where you're at and what you want, and I'm single, so I think I'd feel quite isolated out there, whereas, you know, my friends, you know, they've got a camper van and they just go off together and, oh, we end in 15 seconds.

18
0:04:00.920000-->0:04:01.740000
 Yeah, and you.

19
0:04:01.740000-->0:04:05.920000
 Yeah, the same for you, even with no plans, great weekend.

20
0:04:08.190000-->0:04:08.730000
 Yeah.
