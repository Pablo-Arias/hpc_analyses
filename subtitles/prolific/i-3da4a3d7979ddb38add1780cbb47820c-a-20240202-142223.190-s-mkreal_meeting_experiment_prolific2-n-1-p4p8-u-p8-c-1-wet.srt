 Hi. Can you hear me all right?

1
0:00:15.350000-->0:00:17.770000
 Yes, I can hear you.

2
0:00:24.350000-->0:00:30.610000
 Yes, I don't see myself, but I see you, and I can see you clearly.

3
0:00:42.350000-->0:00:48.450000
 And we have Miss Lina, right?

4
0:00:49.820000-->0:00:51.860000
 Oh, Jasmina, I understand.

5
0:00:52.500000-->0:00:57.120000
 Well, I'm Chris. I'm Chris, and I'm from Scotland.

6
0:01:02.600000-->0:01:10.200000
 Oh, ah, I don't know London well, but I have been to London.

7
0:01:10.200000-->0:01:15.600000
 My grandmother lived in London when I was a child.

8
0:01:22.120000-->0:01:25.540000
 Oh, many years ago, Jasmina.

9
0:01:25.700000-->0:01:31.700000
 Ah, maybe even more than 30 years ago.

10
0:01:31.700000-->0:01:45.910000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

11
0:01:50.050000-->0:02:03.810000
 Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed Scotland.

12
0:02:03.810000-->0:02:06.170000
 You're married, Jasmina?

13
0:02:06.170000-->0:02:17.040000
 I'm not married. I've never been married.

14
0:02:17.040000-->0:02:24.560000
 But I have a lovely family living locally in Scotland,

15
0:02:24.560000-->0:02:38.690000
 including a great, great nephew, a little baby boy, now almost 20 months.

16
0:02:38.690000-->0:02:45.830000
 We have a close family, although I have never been married, and I have no children.

17
0:02:45.830000-->0:02:46.850000
 What about you?

18
0:03:02.750000-->0:03:21.990000
 Ah, and is your husband from Macedonia?

19
0:03:25.890000-->0:03:26.810000
 Poland?

20
0:03:37.110000-->0:03:37.330000
 Ah.

21
0:03:37.750000-->0:03:42.660000
 I've been to Poland many times.

22
0:03:42.660000-->0:03:51.590000
 Ah.

23
0:04:04.250000-->0:04:06.630000
 May I ask you?

24
0:04:06.630000-->0:04:07.110000
 Sorry?
