 Hello there. Hello. I'm fine, thank you. What's your weather doing there? We've got rain today.

1
0:00:19.760000-->0:00:37.720000
 Oh, that's good. No, it's very cloudy here. It's nice and warm here. Yes. Joanne. Joanne.

2
0:00:37.720000-->0:00:50.040000
 Yeah. And you, Femi. Yes. Good. Do you do many of... I'm on the south coast of England in the UK.

3
0:00:52.100000-->0:01:05.960000
 Yes. Where's your accent from? Oh, you're from Nigeria. OK. Yes. So do you do many of these surveys?

4
0:01:10.100000-->0:01:20.290000
 Yes. Now, there's some quite interesting ones around on the psychology departments from the universities.

5
0:01:20.750000-->0:01:31.600000
 I quite like doing the games when they have games to play. I've been doing it exactly a year.

6
0:01:34.500000-->0:01:44.870000
 It is. Yes. But some days I get more surveys than others. I just leave it left open and see whether anything comes up.

7
0:01:48.400000-->0:01:55.990000
 I probably do about three a day, but some of them only pay a few pence and others pay a few pounds.

8
0:01:55.990000-->0:02:03.690000
 So I probably get about 20, 30 pounds a week, something like that, just for a little bit of time.

9
0:02:06.650000-->0:02:18.310000
 Yes. Do you work full time? No. No, I'm studying at the moment.

10
0:02:18.310000-->0:02:23.550000
 I did. I have worked all my life, but I was made redundant recently.

11
0:02:23.550000-->0:02:31.590000
 So I've just been. I'm studying for the church to be a church leader.

12
0:02:37.380000-->0:02:53.710000
 Oh, yes. Very. Yes. So I think it's four minutes.

13
0:02:53.710000-->0:03:03.240000
 Yeah. What do you do in your free time? Do you play football? Basketball?

14
0:03:03.300000-->0:03:11.270000
 Oh, OK. That's not very popular in the UK. Basketball. Not compared with some countries.

15
0:03:11.270000-->0:03:21.560000
 Yes. So are you tall? Yeah. Oh, six two.

16
0:03:21.560000-->0:03:28.370000
 All right. Yes. Well, that's tall enough. Keeps you fit, though.

17
0:03:28.370000-->0:03:32.860000
 You need something to keep you fit. I'm a big follower of cricket.

18
0:03:33-->0:03:39.740000
 But of course, that's probably not something you were brought up on with being in Nigeria.

19
0:03:40-->0:03:51.350000
 But no, it's too hot. I support West Ham.

20
0:03:54.300000-->0:03:58.640000
 Not the best of teams, but I've supported them for a very long time.
