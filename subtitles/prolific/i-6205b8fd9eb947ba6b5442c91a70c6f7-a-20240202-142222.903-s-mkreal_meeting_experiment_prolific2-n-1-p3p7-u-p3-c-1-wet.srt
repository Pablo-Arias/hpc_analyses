 Hi.

1
0:00:14.460000-->0:00:14.480000
 Hi.

2
0:00:14.480000-->0:00:18.070000
 Naima, it's nice to meet you.

3
0:00:24.230000-->0:00:24.610000
 No.

4
0:00:27.750000-->0:00:27.790000
 Have you?

5
0:00:43.930000-->0:00:46.010000
 The puzzle sounds so fun, I would actually be down.

6
0:01:12.020000-->0:01:12.220000
 Yeah.

7
0:01:16.590000-->0:01:16.610000
 No.

8
0:01:16.610000-->0:01:21.270000
 No, that sounds so fun.

9
0:01:22.250000-->0:01:23.190000
 I'm in Manchester.

10
0:01:33.380000-->0:01:33.400000
 Yeah.

11
0:01:33.800000-->0:01:34.120000
 Yeah.

12
0:01:42.650000-->0:01:46.890000
 No, so I'm from Canada, but I got married and my husband's from here, so we're here

13
0:01:46.890000-->0:01:47.130000
 now.

14
0:01:50.040000-->0:01:50.440000
 I do.

15
0:01:50.700000-->0:01:51.260000
 It's very lively.

16
0:01:51.700000-->0:01:58.900000
 So I'm from a smaller city in Canada, so it's not like Toronto or anything like that, it's

17
0:01:58.900000-->0:01:59.380000
 much smaller.

18
0:01:59.700000-->0:02:03.160000
 So being in Manchester, seeing people kind of like out and about all the time, I love

19
0:02:07.810000-->0:02:07.830000
 it.

20
0:02:07.850000-->0:02:08.410000
 No, no, no.

21
0:02:08.410000-->0:02:15.090000
 I grew up in the Toronto area, but when I was about 16, we moved to Edmonton, if you've

22
0:02:15.090000-->0:02:15.510000
 heard of it.

23
0:02:15.510000-->0:02:17.210000
 If you watch hockey, you might know it.

24
0:02:22.290000-->0:02:23.030000
 Yeah, it is.

25
0:02:24.620000-->0:02:24.800000
 I don't know.

26
0:02:24.800000-->0:02:25.740000
 I don't think I do.

27
0:02:27.420000-->0:02:27.720000
 Don't get me wrong.

28
0:02:32.030000-->0:02:32.150000
 I think the UK is great.

29
0:02:32.150000-->0:02:33.030000
 It's got a lot to offer.

30
0:02:38.830000-->0:02:45.580000
 I just think for us, we're a younger couple trying to sort of start our life and buy a

31
0:02:45.580000-->0:02:50.300000
 house and all these things, and I just think it's so unaffordable here, even being in Manchester.

32
0:02:50.300000-->0:02:55.080000
 We moved to Canada for sure.

33
0:03:10.900000-->0:03:12.830000
 Oh, I believe that, but that's in Toronto.

34
0:03:13.550000-->0:03:18.950000
 So I think it also depends on what kind of mortgage you get, if you get a fixed term

35
0:03:18.950000-->0:03:20.230000
 mortgage and that sort of thing.

36
0:03:20.550000-->0:03:25.370000
 So had they gotten a fixed term probably earlier when it was quite low, then they probably

37
0:03:25.550000-->0:03:28.510000
 would have been fine, but that's pretty unfortunate.

38
0:03:28.550000-->0:03:35.440000
 But no, in general though, I would say that if you have a dream house that you want to

39
0:03:35.440000-->0:03:41.400000
 get built, like for me, I watched my parents get a builder to build their house and design

40
0:03:41.400000-->0:03:43.020000
 the cabinets and everything.

41
0:03:43.020000-->0:03:46.020000
 I just think that's so hard to do here.

42
0:03:48.430000-->0:03:57.770000
 It's ridiculous.

43
0:03:59.100000-->0:03:59.280000
 Yeah.

44
0:03:59.280000-->0:04:05.240000
 Well, and the incomes don't change.

45
0:04:06-->0:04:06.240000
 Yeah.
