0:00:04.200000-->0:00:22.770000
 I'm sure you're not good like that.

1
0:00:22.770000-->0:00:32.630000
 You see what I follow talk last night?

2
0:00:32.650000-->0:00:37.090000
 One black person take Canada, one white person shot.

3
0:00:52.760000-->0:00:55.990000
 Black, maybe another person.

4
0:01:04.380000-->0:01:04.800000
 One lady.

5
0:01:07.900000-->0:01:15.650000
 The first person they gave me was my friend.

6
0:01:27.710000-->0:01:28.630000
 It's normal now.

7
0:01:30.750000-->0:01:35.950000
 She told me not to enter the studio because I told her I didn't see the studio.

8
0:01:36.750000-->0:01:40.370000
 She told me not to enter.

9
0:01:45.700000-->0:01:46.500000
 I was like, uh-uh.

10
0:01:59.680000-->0:01:59.800000
 I swear, that kind of thing.

11
0:02:00.540000-->0:02:01.580000
 I'm not bullying you.

12
0:02:07.150000-->0:02:09.230000
 I'm sure they'll find money.

13
0:02:13.100000-->0:02:16.800000
 It was Lagos actually, but I'm at school in Akure.

14
0:02:28.060000-->0:02:29.580000
 This set we just signed out.

15
0:02:31.270000-->0:02:35.580000
 Which department?

16
0:02:40.430000-->0:02:40.450000
 Biology.

17
0:02:40.450000-->0:02:42.670000
 Just came back from Haiti.

18
0:02:48.080000-->0:02:49.360000
 For Lagos, first act.

19
0:02:52.630000-->0:02:53.850000
 Lagos-based TV.

20
0:02:59.880000-->0:03:01.680000
 I watch them full, bro.

21
0:03:01.900000-->0:03:03.540000
 Everybody's attention is just there.

22
0:03:04.860000-->0:03:05.980000
 Mind is there.

23
0:03:05.980000-->0:03:09.920000
 As they just come out that second goal with a score first like this.

24
0:03:09.920000-->0:03:11.940000
 When they go give those guys a penalty.

25
0:03:11.940000-->0:03:15.150000
 Nobody expects them.

26
0:03:16.950000-->0:03:18.550000
 Nobody expects them at all.

27
0:03:18.910000-->0:03:21.630000
 But we should thank God that we got a good keeper.

28
0:03:22.570000-->0:03:24.390000
 The guy keeps on trying.

29
0:03:26.900000-->0:03:30
 It's normal now.

30
0:03:30-->0:03:31.240000
 That kind of thing.

31
0:03:32.400000-->0:03:33.760000
 Everything should be there, right?

32
0:03:35.800000-->0:03:39.160000
 Like I said, this one will reach four minutes now.

33
0:03:41.060000-->0:03:42.420000
 It should be the last one.

34
0:03:42.800000-->0:03:43.800000
 I won't remain for you after this one.

35
0:03:47.350000-->0:03:48.630000
 Relaxing everybody.

36
0:03:53.370000-->0:03:54.710000
 My system will soon die.

37
0:03:58.100000-->0:04:01.630000
 Well, good day Sina, good day John.

38
0:04:02.150000-->0:04:02.950000
 Y'all later my bro.
