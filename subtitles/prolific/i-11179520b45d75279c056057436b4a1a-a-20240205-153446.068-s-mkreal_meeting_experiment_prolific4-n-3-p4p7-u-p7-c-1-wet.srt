 Hello. How are you? Good. Good. I can hear you a little muffled, but I think it will be all right.

1
0:00:25.550000-->0:00:31.450000
 It's all right. How have your past conversation gone?

2
0:00:32.350000-->0:01:00.010000
 Mm-hmm. Is this number three? Yes. Oh, interesting. Well, you've had another one.

3
0:01:04.400000-->0:01:13.200000
 From the States, from New York. I'm based in London for a bit of time now.

4
0:01:13.200000-->0:01:26.290000
 Mm-hmm. How about you? Oh, I love it. I love it. It's been a very positive move for me in many aspects.

5
0:01:27.200000-->0:01:38.830000
 Yes. How about you? Oh, gosh. I got laid off. I was part of the tech layoffs.

6
0:01:38.850000-->0:01:47.830000
 I was working for a very, very big software company, and it's the economy now.

7
0:01:48.850000-->0:02:03.280000
 So that happened, and I have just been figuring things out, which is why I ended up on Prolific, actually, in the meantime, while I'm applying for new jobs.

8
0:02:03.300000-->0:02:15.300000
 But I have a very, very kind and supportive partner as well. So I am lucky in that sense that I have incredible support around me.

9
0:02:15.300000-->0:02:22.200000
 But, yeah, just excited to start another project and go back to work.

10
0:02:24.950000-->0:02:35.920000
 Yeah, well, it's just, you know, it's the times.

11
0:02:36.200000-->0:02:41.530000
 Yeah. Whereabouts are you?

12
0:02:48.790000-->0:02:49.870000
 Fantastic. How is the weather?

13
0:02:53.160000-->0:02:55.020000
 Yeah. Yes.

14
0:02:59-->0:03:08.980000
 Yeah. Well, so it's been a lovely, lovely weekend. It was so sunny. I was up in the Cotswolds, and it was absolutely gorgeous.

15
0:03:11.540000-->0:03:11.720000
 Yeah.

16
0:03:12.680000-->0:03:14.180000
 Hopefully the weather.

17
0:03:15.050000-->0:03:17.950000
 Yes. Yes. Yes.

18
0:03:20.850000-->0:03:25.010000
 It's fantastic. I was just up for a wedding.

19
0:03:27.870000-->0:03:33.790000
 Yeah, so a couple of our friends got married there, and it was just a really beautiful, beautiful time.

20
0:03:34.350000-->0:03:37.910000
 Yeah. For February, especially, it was sunny and 13 degrees.

21
0:03:40.090000-->0:03:40.610000
 Mm-hmm.

22
0:03:43.150000-->0:03:51.810000
 I'm not sure yet. I should assume so, but I've been told just to keep my calendar and my diary empty.

23
0:03:54.200000-->0:03:56.740000
 Yes. What about you?
