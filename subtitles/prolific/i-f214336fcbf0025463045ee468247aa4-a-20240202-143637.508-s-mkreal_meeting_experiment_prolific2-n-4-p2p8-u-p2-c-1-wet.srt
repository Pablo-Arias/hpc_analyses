 Hello. Hi, Chris. I'm Edwina. Hello. How are you? Oh, whereabouts? Oh, right, right.

1
0:00:28.630000-->0:00:37.040000
 So not too cold yet then, I suppose. Is it? Yes, yeah. I'm in Wilmshoe in Cheshire.

2
0:00:39.150000-->0:01:06.130000
 How did you? Twelve miles? Yes, yeah. Oh, lovely, lovely. And I worked in Glasgow, the

3
0:01:06.130000-->0:01:12.350000
 city centre, just doing some consultancy work for a few months, about five years ago.

4
0:01:12.710000-->0:01:31.780000
 So yes, I know Glasgow a little bit, but just the centre. Lovely people. Oh, very much so.

5
0:01:31.780000-->0:01:37.780000
 I did. I did. And it seems like a lot of money's been spent on the city as well.

6
0:02:08.800000-->0:02:17.450000
 It's lovely. It's because we're near the Peak District, it's quite damp most of the time and it's,

7
0:02:17.730000-->0:02:25.430000
 you know, it rains a lot. But apart from that, it's just a lovely place to live. I can walk to all the coffee

8
0:02:25.430000-->0:02:31.530000
 shops and, you know, everything that I need, which for me, health-wise, I've just come out

9
0:02:31.530000-->0:02:36.790000
 of hospital. So it's nice to have everything on my doorstep because I can't drive at the moment.

10
0:02:37.490000-->0:02:43.510000
 So I'm just doing a little bit of walking every day and, you know, taking each day as it comes.

11
0:02:43.510000-->0:02:50.990000
 But yeah, so I like being near, near to everywhere. But yeah, I can't complain.

12
0:02:54.750000-->0:03:03.150000
 Thank you. Thank you. Before I had the surgery, I thought, right, mind over matter. I'm a positive

13
0:03:03.150000-->0:03:10.070000
 person. I'll, you know, I'll recover really quickly. And of course, when there's, you know,

14
0:03:10.070000-->0:03:17.010000
 like a lot of surgery involved and a lot of anaesthetic, it doesn't work out the way your mind

15
0:03:17.010000-->0:03:24.650000
 wants to, you know, unfortunately. So I'm sort of battling with that sort of frustration that

16
0:03:24.650000-->0:03:31.890000
 I can't, you know, I can't make myself better quicker than nature wants me to. But I'll get

17
0:03:31.890000-->0:03:37.070000
 there, you know, it'll just take a little bit of time. And I'm well looked after by, you know,

18
0:03:37.070000-->0:03:44.730000
 the good thing about being around Manchester is, you know, the trust, you know, the NHS trust

19
0:03:44.730000-->0:03:52.750000
 are just fabulous. You know, they really embrace you when you have, you know, when you're not well.

20
0:03:52.750000-->0:03:57.030000
 So I can't complain at that. It looks like our time's up.

21
0:04:02.650000-->0:04:08.460000
 Oh, thank you so much. It's been lovely meeting you too. Bye. Bye.
