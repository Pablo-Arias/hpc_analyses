0:00:00-->0:00:00.140000
 Hello.

1
0:00:00.500000-->0:00:01.150000
 All right.

2
0:00:04.950000-->0:00:05.510000
 You're right.

3
0:00:10.850000-->0:00:14.380000
 My name is Michelle.

4
0:00:14.380000-->0:00:14.660000
 England.

5
0:00:21.950000-->0:00:22.090000
 Are you in England?

6
0:00:28.330000-->0:00:28.450000
 I've never heard of that before.

7
0:00:28.450000-->0:00:28.650000
 I'm in Hull.

8
0:00:31.730000-->0:00:31.750000
 Really?

9
0:00:31.750000-->0:00:32.730000
 Yes, I'm in Hull.

10
0:00:52.730000-->0:00:56.650000
 I think after I would go and look it up, because I don't know, I've never heard of the name

11
0:00:56.650000-->0:00:56.690000
 before.

12
0:00:58.530000-->0:00:58.550000
 Really?

13
0:01:01.320000-->0:01:01.600000
 Oh, wow.

14
0:01:06.730000-->0:01:06.850000
 That's interesting.

15
0:01:10.430000-->0:01:10.510000
 I did not know.

16
0:01:10.510000-->0:01:11.430000
 You know, I say I'll speak for myself.

17
0:01:11.430000-->0:01:12.190000
 We don't really know our side, Manchester, Birmingham, London.

18
0:01:12.190000-->0:01:13.450000
 I've never heard of that before.

19
0:01:18.350000-->0:01:29.870000
 Oh, so like the countryside in the Midlands must be interesting.

20
0:01:46.480000-->0:01:46.560000
 Is it as cold?

21
0:01:58.300000-->0:01:58.420000
 Well, I hate the cold actually.

22
0:02:03.100000-->0:02:17.350000
 I hate the cold actually. I'm about to put my ears on and I'm inside. I'm very cold. I don't like the cold. I can imagine.

23
0:02:17.650000-->0:02:22.810000
 Actually, I would have thought that it would be bubbly. It's not as bubbly as it is in London.

24
0:02:39.800000-->0:03:07.840000
 Before I can understand you clearly, I need to Google your place. I've learnt something to this. I need to Google it. I think I might visit.

25
0:03:07.840000-->0:03:42.700000
 Wow, interesting. So what do you do? I'm a student actually. Wow. So is it like you're restricted? Are you in healthcare? What kind of job are you in?

26
0:03:50.260000-->0:04:06.730000
 What has it been like for you? I've been hoping to have a kid soon but hearing that you've been a mom since 17. Wow. Interesting.

27
0:04:07.550000-->0:04:09.160000
 It's just one you have.
