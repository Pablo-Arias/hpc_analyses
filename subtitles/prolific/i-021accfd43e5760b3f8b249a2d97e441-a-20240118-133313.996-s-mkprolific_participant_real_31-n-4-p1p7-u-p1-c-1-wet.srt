 Hiya. Can you hear me? Yes, I'm actually the researcher, but I think there was a problem

1
0:00:24.340000-->0:00:40.770000
 with this interaction. I think, were you able to interact before with someone? Yeah, I think

2
0:00:40.770000-->0:00:47.900000
 they dropped out, so that's why. That's why you're not seeing anything. Did the other

3
0:00:47.900000-->0:00:56.590000
 ones went alright? Well, okay, so the research is going fine, but we had this participant

4
0:00:56.590000-->0:01:08.130000
 that dropped out, so it just messes with everything, but it's okay. Anyway, thank you very much

5
0:01:08.130000-->0:01:15.450000
 for participating, and it will just move on, and if you can, at the end of the experiment,

6
0:01:15.450000-->0:01:24.070000
 you have a box, and you can just add that you weren't able to interact with someone

7
0:01:24.070000-->0:01:32.120000
 in the last round, okay? Okay, great. Thank you very much. Bye.
