0:00:13.250000-->0:00:30.460000
 There's a little bit of a delay, isn't there? So this is weird. Do we just need to say who

1
0:00:30.460000-->0:00:42.800000
 we are and everything? Yes. Oh, is it? Yeah, I did. I saw a woman. Actually, four minutes

2
0:00:42.800000-->0:00:52.500000
 goes in no time. So whereabouts do you live? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And what made you move to

3
0:00:52.500000-->0:01:14
 Wales? Oh, great. Is it nice? Do you like Wales? Yeah, it is a bit. Yeah, no, I'm in

4
0:01:14-->0:01:23.690000
 South London and it's sunny and mild at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well, it makes it

5
0:01:23.690000-->0:01:34.220000
 green, doesn't it? Uh-huh. Well, sure. Yeah, I've got a garden as well. I've also got a

6
0:01:34.220000-->0:01:41.380000
 very, very active dog. So I spend a lot of time outdoors generally, two or three hours

7
0:01:41.380000-->0:01:51.100000
 a day walking the blooming dog. So yeah. Yeah. It's nice. It keeps me outside and walking

8
0:01:51.100000-->0:02:04.210000
 and everything. How about you? Have you got family or working or what? Oh, right. Oh,

9
0:02:04.210000-->0:02:21.460000
 do you? Yeah. Yeah. And do you like? No. Do you like doing that? Yeah. When you say

10
0:02:21.460000-->0:02:35.510000
 a little garden, is it really quite big? Uh-huh. Oh, well, that sounds nice. That's something

11
0:02:35.510000-->0:02:44.030000
 I'd like a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, excellent. Well, I grew up in Croydon, which is South

12
0:02:44.030000-->0:02:50.870000
 London-ish. And then I went away to university and stuff, but I somehow landed back in South

13
0:02:50.870000-->0:02:56.430000
 London. I would quite like to leave London, but it can be quite hard. You can get stuck

14
0:02:56.430000-->0:03:01.710000
 here. And there are so many advantages and so many disadvantages. So every time you think,

15
0:03:01.710000-->0:03:11.050000
 oh, I want to leave London, you think of all the good things about it. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

16
0:03:13.340000-->0:03:19.510000
 That's not far from me. It's, I don't know, a few miles, half an hour on the train, you

17
0:03:25.750000-->0:03:34.840000
 know. Really? Yeah. Well, it used to be for me, but I think it changes to get older anyway. You

18
0:03:34.840000-->0:03:40.460000
 know, you just want a quieter life. The idea of having a couple of acres of land just sounds

19
0:03:40.460000-->0:03:55.270000
 fab to me. Absolutely fabulous. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, that's wonderful. Yeah. And oh,

20
0:03:55.270000-->0:04:01.770000
 I'm getting flashed. Conversation over in 15 seconds. Yeah, it does go quickly, doesn't it?

21
0:04:01.770000-->0:04:08.330000
 Yeah. Get some walnut trees in as well. Nut trees. Fabulous.
