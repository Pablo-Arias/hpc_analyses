0:00:10.800000-->0:00:26.680000
 I think the first video call is actually working properly. The first one had delay and he couldn't

1
0:00:26.680000-->0:00:32.700000
 hear me quite well and then the last one he was really, really paying down, really couldn't

2
0:00:32.700000-->0:00:48.250000
 understand what he was saying most of the time. So yeah, whereabouts are you? Are you in London now?

3
0:00:48.250000-->0:01:01.560000
 I'm in North Wales. You do? Did you say? Yeah.

4
0:01:02.700000-->0:01:10
 We're nowhere near Snowdonia though. We're basically on the English border, you know, Chester,

5
0:01:11.050000-->0:01:18.200000
 and basically about five miles or so from there, so just over the border really.

6
0:01:18.480000-->0:01:34.170000
 Originally from South Africa, so yeah, and we moved over December 2008, so yeah, it's been a while.

7
0:01:34.170000-->0:01:45.040000
 I don't know where the years have gone, literally just flown by. Johannesburg, you know? Yeah.

8
0:01:45.040000-->0:02:08.440000
 You all right? You all right? What sort of month did you go in? Was it hot? Yeah, it'll be hot then.

9
0:02:11.940000-->0:02:19.710000
 Yeah, well my parents went to visit my brother and his family and they're in a place called

10
0:02:20.090000-->0:02:32.540000
 Somerset West, which is, I think they said an hour or so from Cape Town, or maybe, I don't know, I can't remember, and it was hot.

11
0:02:33.980000-->0:02:39.900000
 Because the thing is, we're native and Cape Town, there's a difference in temperatures,

12
0:02:40.060000-->0:02:47.520000
 but they were just like, I was like, you're not going to stay there, are you? My mum's like, no.

13
0:02:47.740000-->0:03:04.140000
 You know, it's early in the morning, it's wetter, so, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14
0:03:08.820000-->0:03:14
 Did you climb Table Mountain? Yeah. Did you climb Table Mountain?

15
0:03:19.170000-->0:03:28.560000
 Yeah. I haven't done that since we were young, I don't think. Yeah, the thing is,

16
0:03:28.560000-->0:03:38.060000
 it's really hard, because it's hot, it's really hard to hike and things. They went on a walk to

17
0:03:38.060000-->0:03:42.840000
 some gorge or something. They never got there because they were walking for like two hours,

18
0:03:42.920000-->0:03:50.300000
 and because there's been fires like, I don't know, earlier last year, and

19
0:03:50.300000-->0:03:59.480000
 there's literally no trees to shelter under. So, anyway, we've got a few seconds left,

20
0:03:59.480000-->0:04:01.360000
 but in a way, the time's up.

21
0:04:04.810000-->0:04:06.630000
 Nice to see you anyway.
