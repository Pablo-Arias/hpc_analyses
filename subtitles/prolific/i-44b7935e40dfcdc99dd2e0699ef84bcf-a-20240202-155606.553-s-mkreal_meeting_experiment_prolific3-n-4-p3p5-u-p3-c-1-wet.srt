0:00:00-->0:00:28.040000
 No, I just want to make sure we have a chute.

1
0:00:28.040000-->0:00:32.720000
 Oh, um, can you let me know?

2
0:00:39.120000-->0:00:44.280000
 Listen, I think you might have heard that, um,

3
0:00:44.280000-->0:00:47.360000
 we have a lot of people that have farms.

4
0:00:47.360000-->0:00:48.760000
 Okay, so can you let me know?

5
0:00:49.120000-->0:01:02.420000
 Um, well, I can't really figure out why you're making so much noise, but I'm in a very quiet environment.

6
0:01:03.120000-->0:01:04.820000
 Okay.

7
0:01:05.120000-->0:01:07.580000
 I think you might have heard that, um,

8
0:01:07.580000-->0:01:09.120000
 we have a lot of people that have farms.

9
0:01:09.120000-->0:01:09.760000
 Okay.

10
0:01:10.120000-->0:01:11.300000
 So can you let me know?

11
0:01:11.300000-->0:01:15.580000
 Um, I think so.

12
0:01:25.440000-->0:01:27.080000
 I'm in a very quiet environment as well.

13
0:01:27.120000-->0:01:28.960000
 Okay, so can you let me know?

14
0:01:28.960000-->0:01:30.140000
 Okay, so can you let me know?

15
0:01:30.140000-->0:01:30.920000
 Okay, so can you let me know?

16
0:01:30.920000-->0:01:32.120000
 So, I'm gonna text you my address.

17
0:01:32.120000-->0:01:32.820000
 So, I'm gonna text you my address.

18
0:01:32.820000-->0:01:36.140000
 Please, enter my name so I can know that this is the one.

19
0:01:36.280000-->0:01:37.480000
 Alright, thank you.

20
0:01:38.120000-->0:01:39.140000
 Okay.

21
0:01:41.120000-->0:01:47.740000
 Um, I had, um, I was connected to three people, but I couldn't see the first person,

22
0:01:47.740000-->0:01:50.960000
 so I was able to talk to the first, and the second, and the third person.

23
0:02:06.640000-->0:02:06.720000
 Yeah, the first person.

24
0:02:06.720000-->0:02:12.560000
 Well, I think we just want to, um, to see how people react when they meet for the first time,

25
0:02:12.560000-->0:02:15.380000
 like how strangers get affected by the symptoms.

26
0:02:32.400000-->0:02:32.520000
 I think that was very bad.

27
0:02:33.120000-->0:02:36.740000
 Well, I think it's indicated in the instruction of the study.

28
0:02:39.120000-->0:02:42.680000
 It is indicated in the instruction of the study, so I won't read it.

29
0:02:42.680000-->0:02:45.200000
 It's indicated in the instruction.

30
0:03:08.100000-->0:03:08.180000
 I think you do.

31
0:03:37.980000-->0:03:40.200000
 I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I

32
0:03:40.200000-->0:03:47.460000
 love you too much but sweetheart, we're neck to neck so you had to wake me.

33
0:03:57.400000-->0:03:57.440000
 But don't..

34
0:03:57.440000-->0:03:58.580000
 Oh, OK, that's nice. I want to be like you when I grow up!

35
0:04:05.060000-->0:04:08.580000
 I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll...
