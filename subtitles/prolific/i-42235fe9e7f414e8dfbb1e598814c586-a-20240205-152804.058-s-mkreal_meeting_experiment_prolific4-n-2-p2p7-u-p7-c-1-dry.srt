0:02:22.490000-->0:02:30.870000
 I was doing last week where you had to respond so quickly to a image and guess

0:02:30.870000-->0:02:36.350000
 like just you had to use like really good eye coordination and honestly I

11
0:02:36.350000-->0:02:40.630000
 thought I was doing horribly to be honest but it really was just it was

12
0:03:19.250000-->0:03:24.110000
 quite engaging yeah and a lot of them they just take 15-20 minutes and are

13
0:03:24.110000-->0:03:36.130000
 very easy it's just yeah just a little extra every month it helps yeah
