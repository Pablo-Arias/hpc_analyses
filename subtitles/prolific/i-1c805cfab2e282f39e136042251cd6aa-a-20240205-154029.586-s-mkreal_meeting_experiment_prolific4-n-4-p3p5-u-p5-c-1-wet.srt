0:00:10.850000-->0:00:16.260000
 Hi. I can hear you well. Can you hear me?

1
0:00:16.260000-->0:00:16.420000
 Yes.

2
0:00:22.630000-->0:00:24.170000
 Oh, really?

3
0:00:35.650000-->0:00:43.860000
 With four people, four people, four minutes each, but you are my fourth person.

4
0:00:43.860000-->0:00:48.520000
 And I didn't have any problems.

5
0:00:49.560000-->0:00:49.880000
 No.

6
0:00:51.260000-->0:00:51.880000
 Yeah.

7
0:00:58.800000-->0:01:00.760000
 I'm in Brentwood, Essex.

8
0:01:02.740000-->0:01:03.200000
 Yes.

9
0:01:03.700000-->0:01:08.570000
 Oh, I heard about it.

10
0:01:09.150000-->0:01:09.410000
 Yeah.

11
0:01:09.410000-->0:01:11.050000
 I heard about it.

12
0:01:11.050000-->0:01:12.880000
 That's cool.

13
0:01:16.630000-->0:01:17.530000
 Yes.

14
0:01:17.530000-->0:01:24.110000
 Actually, the trains were not running this weekend from Brentwood, so we were stuck.

15
0:01:24.110000-->0:01:26.110000
 We were not stuck, but we couldn't really go.

16
0:01:26.110000-->0:01:30.310000
 Usually, we like to go in London with my husband to explore.

17
0:01:30.310000-->0:01:34.290000
 But this weekend, we stayed locally here, and it was nice.

18
0:01:34.290000-->0:01:35.130000
 It was nice.

19
0:01:38.960000-->0:01:39.260000
 Yeah.

20
0:01:39.260000-->0:01:44.880000
 It's a nice high street, so there are different places to sit and eat.

21
0:01:44.880000-->0:01:46.520000
 We have a park.

22
0:01:46.520000-->0:01:49.840000
 There is a really nice part of Brentwood.

23
0:01:50-->0:01:56.380000
 In the past, it was a psychiatric hospital, but they turned it into like a really fancy apartment.

24
0:01:56.380000-->0:01:59.880000
 So, it's a really nice part to go around.

25
0:02:01-->0:02:01.420000
 Yes.

26
0:02:17.980000-->0:02:18
 Exactly.

27
0:02:19.750000-->0:02:33.780000
 How long are you in politics?

28
0:02:37.860000-->0:02:39.060000
 For how long are you in politics?

29
0:02:48.280000-->0:02:48.300000
 Okay.

30
0:02:50.890000-->0:02:51.650000
 Thank you.

31
0:02:51.650000-->0:02:54.890000
 How long are you in politics?

32
0:02:55.050000-->0:02:57.530000
 For how long are you in politics?

33
0:02:59.550000-->0:03:00.430000
 Okay.

34
0:03:13.050000-->0:03:19.490000
 There are so many people.

35
0:03:47.250000-->0:03:51.270000
 There are good things about AI, but there are some

36
0:03:51.270000-->0:03:53.410000
 disturbing and scary things.

37
0:03:57.450000-->0:03:59.830000
 What's your name just to know?

38
0:04:06.200000-->0:04:08.020000
 Macedonia.
