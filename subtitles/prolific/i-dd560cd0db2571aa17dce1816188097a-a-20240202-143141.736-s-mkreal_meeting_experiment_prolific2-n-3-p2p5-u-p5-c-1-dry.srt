 Hi there, I'm good thank you, I'm Sue. Hi Edwina, whereabouts in the world are you?

1
0:00:27.800000-->0:00:39.420000
 Ah right, I came from that area originally, I'm in Leeds, I came to University in Leeds in 1989 and stayed here, but I'm originally from near Stockport.

2
0:00:39.420000-->0:00:58.960000
 Ah right, well aren't we just, so whereabouts in Cheshire are you?

3
0:00:58.960000-->0:01:08.810000
 Oh right, I have lots of friends who lived in Wilmslow, it's such a small world isn't it, we'll be related soon.

4
0:01:11.250000-->0:01:30.920000
 I love it actually, I've been doing it for quite a few years now, I had to take semi-retirement on health grounds a few years ago and I wanted to do just something else to make a little bit of money, but also out of interest.

5
0:01:30.920000-->0:01:41.940000
 I used to be a researcher and I like the academic study so I just explored this and yeah, quite enjoy it.

6
0:01:42-->0:01:43.620000
 How did you get into it?

7
0:01:57.660000-->0:01:58.120000
 Yeah.

8
0:02:08.740000-->0:02:09.620000
 Isn't it?

9
0:02:14.540000-->0:02:14.900000
 Yeah.

10
0:02:19.900000-->0:02:34.520000
 I've made some really interesting connections as well because I'm a counsellor and one of the studies was about a guy in Australia who was setting up his own sort of mental health platform and he wanted feedback from therapists.

11
0:02:34.900000-->0:02:48.840000
 And we ended up doing a face-to-face online thing, sort of outside Prolific afterwards and I've been really involved in the development of his project and it's been so mutually beneficial, it's been lovely.

12
0:02:48.900000-->0:02:58.400000
 And that all came from an original survey and he's in Australia and it's just fab to, yeah.

13
0:03:06.750000-->0:03:12.750000
 It is fascinating. Fascinating to see what people are researching and studying, isn't it?

14
0:03:34.880000-->0:03:34.900000
 Yeah.

15
0:03:37.420000-->0:03:38.760000
 Right, yeah.

16
0:03:39.700000-->0:03:44.680000
 That's excellent, that's a great thing to do. So you're still working?

17
0:03:44.700000-->0:03:50.940000
 Right, yeah.

18
0:03:56.300000-->0:03:59
 Oh, I was enjoying that.

19
0:04:03.180000-->0:04:03.840000
 Take care.

20
0:04:06-->0:04:06.020000
 Bye.

21
0:04:06.020000-->0:04:06.100000
 Bye.
