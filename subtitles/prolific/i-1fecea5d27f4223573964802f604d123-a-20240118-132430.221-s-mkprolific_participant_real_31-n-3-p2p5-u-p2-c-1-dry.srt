 Hello. Hi. Hi. I can't hear you very well. That's better. Thank you. Thank you. Where

1
0:00:24.210000-->0:00:43.820000
 ... North Wales. Is it cold? What's the weather like at your end? Oh. Oh, right. Well, I live

2
0:00:43.820000-->0:00:51.760000
 by the sea in North Wales, and unusually, we've got snow right on the seafront, which

3
0:00:51.760000-->0:00:57.100000
 is unusual. You can normally see it in the mountains, which there is, but not actually

4
0:00:57.100000-->0:01:16.360000
 on the sand and everything. But you look nice and warm, though. How old are your children?

5
0:01:19.050000-->0:01:24.030000
 Oh, right. So they're still at school. It's not been cancelled with the weather today.

6
0:01:30.750000-->0:01:38.640000
 Which ... But where ... Did you say the East Midlands? Oh, yeah. My sister used to live

7
0:01:38.640000-->0:01:51.220000
 in Leamington Spa, which ... Further. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a bit of a ... Yeah. It's ...

8
0:01:51.220000-->0:02:05.670000
 How long have you been doing Prolific for? It's ideal. Yeah. No, I'm the same, actually. I've

9
0:02:05.670000-->0:02:12.350000
 been doing it for a couple of years. It's ... Do you use the Reddit forum at all? The social media?

10
0:02:19.200000-->0:02:34.210000
 Yeah. It's helpful. Yeah. I find it helpful, like you, if there's any issues at all. So ... Oh,

11
0:02:34.210000-->0:02:42.240000
 yeah. Yeah. No, it's always reassuring, isn't it? Just to check everything's sort of okay.

12
0:02:46.370000-->0:02:54.270000
 HR, human resources, is what I do. So ... But most of the time, I work from home these ... Since

13
0:02:54.270000-->0:03:00.950000
 COVID, actually. So it's a lot better, in that sense, being able to work from home.

14
0:03:01.090000-->0:03:22.250000
 Of course it is. How did they cope during COVID? Because it must have been hard for them.

15
0:03:32.950000-->0:03:45.920000
 And missing their friends as well. Was that hard for them? Interesting how different they are.

16
0:03:52.850000-->0:04:01.460000
 Okay. Oh. Oh, listen, it looks like our time's up, but it's lovely to meet you.

17
0:04:04.500000-->0:04:09.540000
 Yeah. It's unusual, isn't it? Oh.
