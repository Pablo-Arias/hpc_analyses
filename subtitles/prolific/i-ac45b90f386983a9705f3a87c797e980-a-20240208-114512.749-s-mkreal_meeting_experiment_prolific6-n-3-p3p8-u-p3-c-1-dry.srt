0
0:00:14.850000-->0:00:25.960000
 My guy, I don't cash you, I don't cash you

1
0:00:27.050000-->0:00:28.390000
 Wait, wait

2
0:00:37.950000-->0:00:42.740000
 The person I talked to first was British, in the UK

3
0:00:43.300000-->0:00:51.430000
 But he's old, old

4
0:00:51.430000-->0:00:55.970000
 No, no, no, but she was black too

5
0:00:57.250000-->0:01:02.890000
 The next person I talked to was a Nigerian

6
0:01:02.950000-->0:01:07.080000
 No, no, that guy

7
0:01:24.200000-->0:01:26.640000
 But she said she did it for a week

8
0:01:27.150000-->0:01:28.240000
 You know Sabi?

9
0:01:29.750000-->0:01:30.870000
 Okay, okay

10
0:01:36.550000-->0:01:37.370000
 Study, okay

11
0:01:38.050000-->0:01:39.930000
 Five pounds, yeah

12
0:01:44.850000-->0:01:47.390000
 I was waiting for five for a year

13
0:01:52.080000-->0:01:56.080000
 I don't want to enter the study too, because my account is a female account

14
0:01:56.080000-->0:01:59.240000
 So, the reason is that I can't enter

15
0:01:59.700000-->0:02:01.590000
 I think I'll just enter Nigeria

16
0:02:01.750000-->0:02:03.690000
 I don't, yeah, yeah, yeah

17
0:02:04.660000-->0:02:05.660000
 Waiting for the day now

18
0:02:08.850000-->0:02:10.530000
 Where for Nigeria is the day?

19
0:02:18.700000-->0:02:19.620000
 Okay, Futa?

20
0:02:23.200000-->0:02:25.170000
 Oh, I'm just filming from Futa too now

21
0:02:27.710000-->0:02:30.290000
 Yeah, yeah, no, I'm just doing my project for Defence

22
0:02:31.170000-->0:02:32.730000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure

23
0:02:33.290000-->0:02:37.460000
 Yeah, biology

24
0:02:41.550000-->0:02:43.170000
 Okay, my dear

25
0:02:43.810000-->0:02:44.610000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

26
0:02:45.100000-->0:02:46.040000
 What did you write?

27
0:02:52.600000-->0:02:54.060000
 I see yesterday's match now

28
0:02:55.550000-->0:02:56.870000
 No, no, no, I can't do this

29
0:03:02.240000-->0:03:02.920000
 Guy

30
0:03:09.490000-->0:03:11.210000
 Guy, plot twist

31
0:03:11.210000-->0:03:12.370000
 Plot twist, way mad

32
0:03:14.750000-->0:03:15.730000
 Plot twist, way mad

33
0:03:23.500000-->0:03:24.780000
 Sure, sure, sure, sure, the guy tried

34
0:03:26.350000-->0:03:27.870000
 I know how to focus up

35
0:03:44.470000-->0:03:46.010000
 Yeah, yeah, and I worry me after this

36
0:04:02.280000-->0:04:02.300000
 Sorry

37
0:04:02.300000-->0:04:02.960000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
