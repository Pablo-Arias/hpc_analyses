 Hello. Hi, how are you? My name is... I'm fine. How's your day going? Alright. Alright, that's

1
0:00:29.650000-->0:00:40.530000
 fine. Sorry. My name is Zaya. What's your name? Oh, Zaya. Nice to meet you. I have a

2
0:00:40.530000-->0:01:02.230000
 cousin named Zoe. Yeah. Yes. I'm in the UK right now. Oh, I'm in Princeton. Oh, that's

3
0:01:02.230000-->0:01:24.130000
 cool. That's good to know. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Privacy. Yeah. Yeah, it is. So cool. So, yeah.

4
0:01:24.130000-->0:01:34.310000
 What kind of dog do you have? Oh, okay. Oh, Labrador Retrievers. They're really cute.

5
0:01:34.430000-->0:01:39.830000
 I like that. I don't have a dog, though, but I'm a little bit scared of them, like touching

6
0:01:39.830000-->0:01:51.430000
 them. Yeah, a little bit. But I like them. I just, I don't know. I think when I was little,

7
0:01:51.430000-->0:02:00.800000
 I had like a dog. It bit me. So since then, I've just been a little bit scared. Yeah.

8
0:02:06.650000-->0:02:11.850000
 I'm hoping to meet one soon. I actually would like to own a dog, but since I can't really

9
0:02:11.850000-->0:02:32.470000
 touch them, there's no point. Yeah. Yes. Okay. So, I think a Chihuahua. Yeah, a little.

10
0:02:32.470000-->0:02:42.360000
 Yeah. So like, they just be following me everywhere, all about the house, everywhere. Yeah, I've

11
0:02:42.360000-->0:02:46.560000
 heard so, that it's very lovely for you. They take care of you. They can be emotionally

12
0:02:46.560000-->0:03:01.520000
 compatible with you. They know how to cheer you up in little ways. Yeah. But I used to

13
0:03:01.520000-->0:03:13.890000
 have a tortoise, though, when I was much younger. There's a tortoise. Yeah. Well, I don't know

14
0:03:13.890000-->0:03:27.710000
 what happened to him. One day, he just, that was it. He just wasn't living anymore. No,

15
0:03:27.710000-->0:03:33.030000
 they are really slow. They take their time. And he was kind of big. So yeah, I think he

16
0:03:33.030000-->0:03:40.150000
 was just like slowly crawling in. But he's got his own space. So, it's just crawl around

17
0:03:40.150000-->0:03:43.690000
 its space. And when it's tired, it should just sit down. It should just, I don't know

18
0:03:43.690000-->0:03:57.830000
 but it should just stay one place. Just stay at a place. I think his name was Alan. I didn't

19
0:03:57.830000-->0:04:01.510000
 really name it. Yes, I didn't really name it. But I think I used to call it Alan once

20
0:04:01.510000-->0:04:09.480000
 in a while, but I didn't name it. Yay!
