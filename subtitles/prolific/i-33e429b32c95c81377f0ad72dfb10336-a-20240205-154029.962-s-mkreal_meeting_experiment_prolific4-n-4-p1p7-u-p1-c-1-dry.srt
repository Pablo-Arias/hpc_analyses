 I am all alone, but there is some building construction I have to do, so I am going to

1
0:00:29.660000-->0:00:36
 do it outside, maybe that is the reason. Thank you for asking by the way, I am good,

2
0:00:36-->0:00:42.760000
 I hope you are good too. My name is Merve and I am from Turkey, I am a student in the

3
0:00:55.640000-->0:01:02.940000
 You came from New York to London, that's great. Do you like living in London? I have never

4
0:01:02.940000-->0:01:18.400000
 been to London. I am in Exeter. It is nice, it is very green and I would say it is very

5
0:01:18.400000-->0:01:25.360000
 small, because I used to live in Istanbul and this is a very small place for me, but

6
0:01:25.360000-->0:01:34.480000
 I still like that quietness and peace behind me. It is nice, but I am coming to London

7
0:01:34.480000-->0:01:38.540000
 on the 20th of February, so I can't wait.

8
0:01:39.500000-->0:01:55.940000
 Hopefully, not much, because I will be there for a conference and I don't think I will

9
0:01:55.940000-->0:02:02.840000
 have much time, but it is just going to be a taster and then I am sure I will come more

10
0:02:02.840000-->0:02:19.800000
 that I have the chance. Is there anything? No, I think a week must be spent in London

11
0:02:19.800000-->0:02:26.500000
 in order to see everything, if you want to do. It is amazing.

12
0:02:50.500000-->0:02:59.840000
 Okay, you got me there. That is what I heard from everyone. Do you find it difficult to

13
0:02:59.840000-->0:03:08.680000
 get up to London after New York? Is this enough? No, not yet.

14
0:03:30.500000-->0:03:32.760000
 No, not yet.

15
0:03:41.760000-->0:03:43.520000
 That reminds me of Istanbul.

16
0:03:45.500000-->0:04:03.280000
 I am glad you love it. I don't know if you are going to stay forever, but it looks like

17
0:04:03.280000-->0:04:06.400000
 you are very happy in London.
