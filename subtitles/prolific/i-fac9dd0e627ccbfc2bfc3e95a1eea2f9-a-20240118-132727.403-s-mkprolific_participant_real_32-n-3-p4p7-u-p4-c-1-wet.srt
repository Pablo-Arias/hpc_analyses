 Hi there, how are you doing? I'm alright, not bad. This is a random experiment to be

1
0:00:20.290000-->0:00:35.170000
 doing, isn't it? It is, it's very strange. But I was saying to the last girl I chatted

2
0:00:35.170000-->0:00:40.550000
 to, it's been all females I've spoken to. I don't know if you've been the same. Yeah.

3
0:00:42.400000-->0:01:04.760000
 Wow. Yeah. Yeah, well I'm up north, I'm in Scotland. So, alright, so I'm the other side,

4
0:01:04.760000-->0:01:15.890000
 I'm Aberdeen, so I'm the east coast. We've got about a foot of snow at the moment. Yeah.

5
0:01:16.090000-->0:01:39.070000
 So, very cold. But beautiful to look at. No. Yeah, okay. No, well even here, like our country

6
0:01:39.070000-->0:01:43.910000
 schools, like I'm in the city, but the ones like kind of out with the city centre, they're

7
0:01:43.910000-->0:01:55.720000
 all closed. But you can't get to them, it's the transport that's the issue. Yeah. I've

8
0:01:55.720000-->0:02:01.540000
 got two dogs, so I have to go out in the snow. Yeah, I'm permanently out walking them,

9
0:02:01.540000-->0:02:12.710000
 so they love the snow. I've got two Cocker Spaniels, so I've got one that's three years

10
0:02:12.710000-->0:02:19.650000
 old and I've just got a puppy in November, so he's now four months old. What about you?

11
0:02:31.200000-->0:02:37.610000
 Okay. It was fine. I've done it before, but the dogs, my other dog was a lot older, he

12
0:02:37.610000-->0:02:44.870000
 was nine when we got our puppy, so this time around it's been so much easier and our dog's

13
0:02:44.870000-->0:02:50.190000
 still quite playful. So, you know, they're a perfect match. You know, they have their

14
0:02:50.190000-->0:02:56.990000
 odd squabbles and things, but it's brilliant. You know, they lie curled up together, so

15
0:02:56.990000-->0:03:06.410000
 yeah, I would recommend it. It's hard work. It really is hard work. It is at the moment,

16
0:03:06.410000-->0:03:11.210000
 because obviously the little one can't walk the same as the older one, so you're sort

17
0:03:11.210000-->0:03:16.550000
 of restricted walks and things, but once they both are up walking, you know, their Spaniels

18
0:03:16.550000-->0:03:21.790000
 will walk for hours, but at the moment it's that restricted walking, so he's just mannequin

19
0:03:21.790000-->0:03:34.910000
 the house. There's no off switch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but no, it's really good fun. I would

20
0:03:34.910000-->0:04:00.510000
 recommend it. Yeah. Apart from the vet bills, that's probably the downside. Yeah, so double

21
0:04:00.510000-->0:04:09.740000
 the cost, but they entertain each other, so yeah. Yeah, well that's it. Nice to meet you.
