 How are you? Good, thank you. My name is Yasmina, Jasmine. If it's my original name is Yasmina,

1
0:00:28.050000-->0:00:34.670000
 but people struggle, and then I say Jasmine. Ah, Jasmine, okay, that's easy. So Yasmina

2
0:00:34.670000-->0:01:10.260000
 is my name. Lia, nice to meet you. I'm living in London. How about you? Ah, okay, yes. Yes,

3
0:01:10.260000-->0:01:17.520000
 I love it for many reasons. I don't like the weather, and I'm sure it's not the first person

4
0:01:17.520000-->0:01:27.560000
 saying it. I'm here since 2016 for eight years, but I just still didn't get used to the cold.

5
0:01:27.640000-->0:01:36.120000
 But otherwise, I love it. It's a big city, it's offering so much. I'm a wheelchair user,

6
0:01:36.120000-->0:01:59.240000
 so accessibility is fantastic, so it's really... Oh, no, no. I have traveled around the world,

7
0:01:59.240000-->0:02:07.140000
 and I'm always saying we are more or less as United States, which is the... I mean,

8
0:02:07.140000-->0:02:13.180000
 UK and United States the best regarding accessibility. All the rest of the world,

9
0:02:13.180000-->0:02:31.660000
 and Europe, it cannot compare with what we have here in UK. Macedonia, I don't know if you have

10
0:02:31.660000-->0:02:52.180000
 heard. Yes. No, many people don't know it, and actually, we are a really small country. We are

11
0:02:52.180000-->0:03:01.340000
 only two million people, and yes, so it's not weird if someone doesn't know where we are.

12
0:03:02.210000-->0:03:15.130000
 But we are located, I don't know if you know, above Greece, Serbia, that region. We are on the

13
0:03:15.130000-->0:03:32.990000
 Balkans. Exactly. Exactly. Well, I came here for my master's degree. I did, yes. I was doing my

14
0:03:32.990000-->0:03:45.870000
 master's Human Resources in Kingston University, and then I met my husband here, and we just did

15
0:03:45.870000-->0:03:51.310000
 his work in here. I'm working from home. I'm flexible, but because of his work,

16
0:03:51.350000-->0:04:02.700000
 we stayed here, and we love it. It's beautiful. And you, are you originally from Zagorod?
