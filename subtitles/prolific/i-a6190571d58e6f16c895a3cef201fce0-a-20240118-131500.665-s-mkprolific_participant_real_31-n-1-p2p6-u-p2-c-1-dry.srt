 Hello, hi, hi, hi Thang, see you. North Wales, whereabouts are you?

1
0:00:24.350000-->0:00:34.150000
 Oh right, yeah, I used to live in Hertfordshire and also Milton Keynes, so I'm familiar with the area.

2
0:00:34.150000-->0:00:38.250000
 What's the weather like at the moment?

3
0:00:44.200000-->0:00:54.700000
 Yeah, I live by the sea, but unusually we've still got snow right on the seafront, which is really unusual, but it's probably colder inland, I would have thought.

4
0:00:54.700000-->0:00:57.440000
 But yeah, there's loads of snow on the mountains here.

5
0:01:03.250000-->0:01:12.890000
 Oh, but it's gorgeous in the summer, it's really nice looking over Anglesey and the views of the mountains, that's really nice.

6
0:01:12.890000-->0:01:14.810000
 So whereabouts in Bedfordshire are you?

7
0:01:16.250000-->0:01:29.040000
 Oh yeah, yeah. Is it Bobby Brewster? The books, growing up, is it Bobby Brewster? Is it Bobby Brewster books from Biggleswade?

8
0:01:29.040000-->0:01:41.620000
 It is. Years ago, growing up, I remember reading. I only know about the area, as I say, because I, you know, I lived sort of in Milton Keynes and Hertfordshire and so on, so I'm vaguely familiar with the area.

9
0:01:45.550000-->0:01:54.740000
 Oh, I'm just trying to think, a couple of years now. What about yourself? Oh, okay.

10
0:02:07.550000-->0:02:14.740000
 And apparently, I don't know if you use Reddit at all as a social media? Yeah, yeah.

11
0:02:15.600000-->0:02:26.520000
 Yeah, and that's where, apparently, isn't it, where people, if you do a lot of studies or time or whatever, it slows down.

12
0:02:26.520000-->0:02:36.240000
 And I've noticed certainly, even in the last year, it's slowed down loads. There's a lot more people that I guess who've joined as well.

13
0:02:36.240000-->0:02:44.950000
 But it's still good, isn't it? Yeah, something like that. Yeah.

14
0:02:53.500000-->0:03:02.300000
 It's reassuring. There's a lot of quite negative people on it, though, as well, do you find? It's quite funny, it makes me laugh sometimes.

15
0:03:03.500000-->0:03:20.780000
 Yeah. Oh, I know. They get loads.

16
0:03:29.450000-->0:03:34.630000
 We just leap through it, there's one, and then we don't get into it anyway, do we? But it's good.

17
0:03:35.450000-->0:03:42.050000
 I like the feeling of contributing to research as well, as well as obviously it's helpful for us. It's good, isn't it?

18
0:03:48.500000-->0:03:56.860000
 I know. Yeah, I was just looking at the computer doing, oh, we've got 15. Oh, well, it's lovely to meet you anyway.

19
0:03:57.500000-->0:04:08.910000
 Yeah, yeah. What's your name? Sorry, my name's Jill Rayner. Oh, it's lovely to meet you.
