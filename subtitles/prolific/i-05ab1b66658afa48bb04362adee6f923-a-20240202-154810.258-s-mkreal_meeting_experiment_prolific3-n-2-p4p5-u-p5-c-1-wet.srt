 Hello. I'm fine. Can you hear me properly?

1
0:00:18.450000-->0:00:22.440000
 It's okay. I can't see myself, which is a little strange.

2
0:00:26.750000-->0:00:33.830000
 You can't see me? Oh! Okay.

3
0:00:35.050000-->0:00:38.240000
 This is a bit, this is a bit interesting.

4
0:00:42.800000-->0:00:46.050000
 I am, um, I'm fine.

5
0:00:46.050000-->0:00:49.990000
 It's just that I've got a bad leg, so I'm at home doing stuff instead of being out.

6
0:00:52.860000-->0:00:54.680000
 So I'm not having a lot of fun.

7
0:00:54.680000-->0:00:58.640000
 Yeah, but my leg really, really hurts.

8
0:00:58.640000-->0:01:03.680000
 So, please, I would like to just go for a walk again without having to lay in bed.

9
0:01:03.680000-->0:01:05.240000
 But I'm getting there.

10
0:01:05.400000-->0:01:09.400000
 I think it's the cold as well that's making it even worse.

11
0:01:12.400000-->0:01:14.270000
 I twisted my ankle.

12
0:01:14.270000-->0:01:16.890000
 Um, it's a long story.

13
0:01:16.890000-->0:01:22.510000
 And I've pulled my achilles and I haven't been able to walk for a week.

14
0:01:22.850000-->0:01:31.610000
 Yeah. Yeah.

15
0:01:33.150000-->0:01:40.010000
 I've been resting for ages and I'm just waiting for it to heal.

16
0:01:40.150000-->0:01:48.110000
 I'm hoping because it's really calmed down a lot because before, like, I would get out of bed, I would step down and it's excruciating.

17
0:01:48.150000-->0:01:49.870000
 Now it's not so bad.

18
0:01:50.150000-->0:01:51.950000
 It's improving.

19
0:01:55-->0:01:58
 Yeah, I have to. I have to.

20
0:02:00.100000-->0:02:00.890000
 That's you.
