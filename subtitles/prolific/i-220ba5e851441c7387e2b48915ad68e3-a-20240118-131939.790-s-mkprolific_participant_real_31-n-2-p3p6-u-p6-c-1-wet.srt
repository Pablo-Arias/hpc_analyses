 Hiya! Have you had one? My name's Raina, what's yours? Oh hi Martha, whereabouts are you located?

1
0:00:21.600000-->0:00:30.420000
 Oh hi, okay that's not too far from me, I'm in Bedfordshire, so I think you're like maybe

2
0:00:30.420000-->0:00:37.930000
 an hour's drive further on the A1M, so yeah. It's cold today isn't it? I've been freezing

3
0:00:37.930000-->0:00:48.490000
 all day. I've got a blanket over me, but yeah, it's going to get worse as well apparently.

4
0:00:49.430000-->0:00:55.850000
 In Northern Ireland, my job means that I kind of work from the UK, but I also work in Northern

5
0:00:55.850000-->0:01:01.070000
 Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and they've got like a national emergency there today

6
0:01:01.070000-->0:01:05.030000
 with the snow, like everything's closed down, there's no transport in and out, so oh god

7
0:01:05.030000-->0:01:32.770000
 that's coming our way. Like Bambi on ice. Oh brilliant, yeah me too. So I work for a

8
0:01:32.770000-->0:01:39.890000
 retail company, so we basically like, we've got shops all over, but I kind of, it's weird

9
0:01:39.890000-->0:01:44.590000
 because I'm based in the UK and I'd probably say like 90% of my job is in the Republic

10
0:01:44.590000-->0:01:49.490000
 of Ireland, so yeah, 10% sort of in Northern Ireland and then the rest of it's in Republic

11
0:01:49.490000-->0:01:54.490000
 of Ireland, so it's quite good because I get to go over probably every quarter, which is

12
0:01:54.490000-->0:02:11.910000
 quite nice, so yeah. What is it that you do? Oh wow, oh it'd go straight over my head,

13
0:02:11.910000-->0:02:33.400000
 I can imagine. And I like the fact that you can withdraw it straight away as well, that

14
0:02:33.400000-->0:02:36.880000
 helps doesn't it? Like if you need petrol or something, you're like okay quick, go on

15
0:02:36.880000-->0:02:41.740000
 please quick, and then withdraw some of my balance. But your job must be tough in the

16
0:02:41.740000-->0:03:09.050000
 current climate right, because the prices I presume are going up and down. Yeah, and

17
0:03:09.050000-->0:03:16.710000
 with all the wars and stuff, does that impact it as well, like stuff that's going out? Yeah.

18
0:03:40.440000-->0:04:06.810000
 Oh no. Oh no. You need stability in the world. Yes, me too.
