0:00:04.350000-->0:00:17.610000
 Hi, are you okay? I'm good, thank you. My first person didn't work, so I don't know.

1
0:00:18.750000-->0:00:29.800000
 I've just had a technical issue or something, I don't think. Oh, right. Okay, then. Well,

2
0:00:29.800000-->0:00:37.820000
 I live in the Midlands. I don't know whereabouts you are. How long have you done Prolific for?

3
0:00:40-->0:00:46.240000
 Yeah, I've just had a knee replacement about, what are we now, five weeks ago, so I'm just,

4
0:00:47.100000-->0:00:51.440000
 well, I've been waiting to get this knee done, which has taken for ages, as you can imagine,

5
0:00:51.440000-->0:00:56.600000
 with the NHS at the moment. I've just been doing Prolific because I can do it at home and

6
0:00:56.860000-->0:00:59.460000
 you don't turn a lot, do you? But it's a bit.

7
0:01:04.950000-->0:01:15.170000
 Yeah, I mean, I'm hoping to go back to work. I've been stuck at home, what, two years now,

8
0:01:15.350000-->0:01:23.630000
 so it's as much as I love my house. I'm like, no. I'm like, I want to talk to other people now.

9
0:01:26.090000-->0:01:31.350000
 Cabin fever, yes. All right, when my son's at home from uni at Christmas or something, but

10
0:01:31.350000-->0:01:36.810000
 one of my other kids lives in America and the other ones, they're just really busy, so

11
0:01:37.690000-->0:01:39.610000
 not a lot going on, really.

12
0:01:43.660000-->0:01:49.760000
 Oh, God, make the most of it. Make the most of it. Honestly, when they leave, it's horrendous.

13
0:01:49.760000-->0:01:57.550000
 I hate it. Yeah.

14
0:02:01.260000-->0:02:03.080000
 I know it's really hard now. My son's up in Edge Hill. He's doing teaching up there. That's

15
0:02:05.440000-->0:02:08.720000
 the youngest one. I've got three kids, so we live about an hour and a half away from there,

16
0:02:08.720000-->0:02:17.240000
 so it's not too bad. But the. Yes, it is. Yeah, yeah. Ormskirk. But they don't give them much

17
0:02:17.240000-->0:02:25.060000
 student loan anymore, so get saving. Yeah, that's my only advice.

18
0:02:30.380000-->0:02:33.700000
 And it's the accommodation. Accommodation is like massive. He's got. If he was just left to

19
0:02:33.700000-->0:02:40.040000
 his own devices, he'd have 400 pounds for this whole term for everything. That's how sort of much

20
0:02:41.220000-->0:02:45.840000
 the company has gone in a better accommodation. He could have gone in cheaper accommodation, but

21
0:02:50.720000-->0:02:52.740000
 he's autistic, Matt, so we don't like to put him under any pressure anywhere. Yeah,

22
0:02:57.180000-->0:02:57.520000
 so they've been very good up there. They've let him stay on campus all the three years

23
0:03:00.960000-->0:03:04.260000
 he's been there so that he doesn't have to do the change. So, yeah, yeah, yeah. Every Wednesday,

24
0:03:04.260000-->0:03:10.260000
 he loves it. Yeah, he's hoping to go to Japan. He's never been out the country, so I don't know

25
0:03:10.260000-->0:03:13.020000
 how that's going to happen. But he's hoping to do this Tefl thing and go and teach in Japan

26
0:03:15.500000-->0:03:20.800000
 later on in the year. So, no, I don't think so. I mean, maybe the teacher is going to be

27
0:03:25.850000-->0:03:31.690000
 No, I don't think so. I mean, maybe the Tefl is just a qualification to speak,

28
0:03:31.690000-->0:03:36.990000
 sorry, to teach in Japan. You don't have to speak Japanese, but you have to be able to

29
0:03:37.430000-->0:03:46.390000
 thingy. So he loves that anime culture and all that kind of crap. So I'm not into it at all.

30
0:03:46.470000-->0:03:57.160000
 It says, yeah, we can't for someone who is so disorganized. It's over in 15 seconds. So nice

31
0:03:57.160000-->0:04:02.220000
 to meet you. We can't believe how organized he's been with his uni course because he can

32
0:04:02.220000-->0:04:07.520000
 like come back and the place is like a tip within his bedroom is a tip within like two days.

33
0:04:07.520000-->0:04:09.540000
 But when it goes to uni, everything's organized.
