 Hello. Hiya, how are you? Is that better? Yeah, not bad. I can't complain, it's Friday, so you know, that's nice. How about you? Good. Yeah, definitely. Oh, nice.

1
0:00:38.650000-->0:00:49.210000
 I don't. To be fair, actually, it's quite relaxed. I think I'll probably just relax, catch up on a bit of life admin and, you know, watch some TV, maybe go see some family. That's it really.

2
0:00:49.210000-->0:01:06.270000
 So fairly relaxed. It's nice having a chill weekend once in a while, I think. Yeah. Yeah, I think sometimes I feel like I'm just a headless chicken running around, so it's nice just to not have that as well.

3
0:01:06.650000-->0:01:42.370000
 It's good. Yeah. I work for a telecoms company, working in their commercial team. So that's what I do day to day. How about you? Oh, nice. Yeah. Fair enough. And do you enjoy that? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

4
0:01:42.370000-->0:02:22.860000
 Sounds like a really interesting role. I'm based in the West Midlands. How about you? Oh, nice. I've been to Leeds before. It's a lovely place. You must really like it then. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Yeah.

5
0:02:22.860000-->0:02:35.390000
 We live kind of. Oh, sorry. Yeah. I was going to say I've always lived in the Midlands and we've kind of live in a bit of a suburban area, but you can get into the city centre like Birmingham within about half an hour.

6
0:02:35.390000-->0:02:43.370000
 But then the other side, you do get the countryside and you can go down to like Worcester kind of way as well and get the Malvern Hills, which is quite nice.

7
0:02:43.370000-->0:03:28.910000
 So I think it's nice having that mix so you're not always in one too much. You can kind of pick and choose a little bit. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's a convenience, isn't it? Sometimes that does help. Yeah. Yeah. No.

8
0:03:28.910000-->0:04:01.630000
 I think it's probably one of those where you'd get used to it if you're there, but at the same time, it's, you know, you don't get that convenience, which just adds more stress than you need, really. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that that was quite good. Well, it was really nice to meet you and I hope you have a lovely weekend.

9
0:04:04.270000-->0:04:06.930000
 And it'll be a nice relaxing one.
