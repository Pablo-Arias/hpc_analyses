0:00:10.950000-->0:00:21.780000
 Can you hear me okay? You can't hear me? Alright, I'll just speak louder.

1
0:00:28.950000-->0:00:34.800000
 Okay, I'm Leslie and I'm from Aberdeen up in Scotland, so completely other end of the country.

2
0:00:39.840000-->0:00:40.200000
 Yeah.

3
0:00:45.940000-->0:00:46.340000
 Oh.

4
0:00:48.500000-->0:01:03.670000
 To be honest, you possibly didn't miss much. I mean, Glasgow and Edinburgh have got a bit more to the cities rather than Aberdeen, so you maybe were lucky. It's a beautiful city.

5
0:01:03.670000-->0:01:17.620000
 Okay.

6
0:01:21.700000-->0:01:24.080000
 Which course was it you were wanting?

7
0:01:25.650000-->0:01:26.290000
 Which course?

8
0:01:27.870000-->0:01:28.290000
 Okay.

9
0:01:38.950000-->0:01:58.290000
 I studied in Swansea, of all places in Wales. Marine biology, I studied, and I now work in Aberdeen for the NHS, so putting my degree to good use.

10
0:02:05.600000-->0:02:23.720000
 I think it's called transferable skills. I'm using my statistical background for data analysis. I think we can roughly say, but I got married and had kids so I couldn't travel the world like I did when I first graduated, so next best option.

11
0:02:29-->0:02:33.350000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't get a good pay though.

12
0:02:37.900000-->0:02:40.160000
 Yeah. What is it you do?

13
0:02:52.900000-->0:02:53.300000
 Yeah.

14
0:02:55.900000-->0:02:59.580000
 It's a nice easy experiment this though. It's very straight.

15
0:03:00.900000-->0:03:01.100000
 Yeah.

16
0:03:02.950000-->0:03:04.510000
 I did a similar one.

17
0:03:06.270000-->0:03:06.690000
 No.

18
0:03:07.950000-->0:03:10.190000
 You're allowed to yap about whatever you want.

19
0:03:12.950000-->0:03:17.170000
 It's funny I did a similar one last week, and it was all females I spoke to.

20
0:03:17.950000-->0:03:23.830000
 And so far my conversations have all been females so I'll be interested to see if my remaining ones are female.

21
0:03:49.250000-->0:03:56.570000
 I think, I think we've got the ability to chat about anything, whereas maybe men are a bit more reserved about what they speak.

22
0:03:57.800000-->0:03:59.480000
 Oh, let's see.

23
0:04:06.980000-->0:04:07
 Yeah.

24
0:04:07-->0:04:07.540000
 Oh, I'm waiting.
