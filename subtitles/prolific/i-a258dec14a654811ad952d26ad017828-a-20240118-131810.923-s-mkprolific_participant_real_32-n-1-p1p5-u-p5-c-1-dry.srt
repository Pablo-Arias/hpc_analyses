 Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I'm not sure what we're supposed to talk about,

1
0:00:23.790000-->0:00:43.870000
 do you know? Okay. My name is Annette and I live in Exeter. What about you? Oh, wow.

2
0:00:43.870000-->0:00:50.130000
 Okay. So I've never been to Derbyshire. I think the northest I've been was to Sheffield.

3
0:00:50.130000-->0:00:56.820000
 So it doesn't really count, I suppose. Oh, no, the train goes through Derby, right? It

4
0:00:56.820000-->0:01:20.880000
 goes Derby and then it goes to Sheffield. I see. Do you enjoy living there? Okay. Wow.

5
0:01:20.880000-->0:01:31.470000
 What kind of dog do you have? I like dogs. I do have a cat. I'm a reformed dog person.

6
0:01:31.470000-->0:01:49.550000
 Oh, my God. That's amazing. Is that a cat behind you? I thought I'd see something white

7
0:01:49.550000-->0:02:02.170000
 sticking out and I have a black and white cat. So she randomly sticks out places. How

8
0:02:02.170000-->0:02:21.460000
 did you end up with nine cats? There we go. Yeah, that's amazing. I mean, I don't know

9
0:02:21.460000-->0:02:27.860000
 how much you spend on the cat food, but yeah, it's amazing to have them all around, I bet.

10
0:02:31.360000-->0:02:38.490000
 That's good. Bless her. Yeah, I sometimes wonder what they think, yeah.

11
0:02:43.080000-->0:03:13.710000
 Oh, bless her. Yeah. Oh, bless her. Yeah, bless them. But it's a long time for a cat,

12
0:03:13.710000-->0:03:17.590000
 15 years. It's a long time, so that was a good going.

13
0:03:24.620000-->0:03:29.480000
 Bless them. Did you notice that they're kind of slower like people,

14
0:03:29.480000-->0:03:33.140000
 like kind of slower to move as they age or not really?

15
0:03:45.450000-->0:03:58.980000
 Oh, bless her. Yeah. Oh, that's horrible. But then at least she thought she is fine

16
0:03:58.980000-->0:04:04.920000
 up until the end. So that's good. That's good for her. Okay, so we have 15 seconds.

17
0:04:04.920000-->0:04:07.340000
 So it was lovely to meet you.
