0:00:18.940000-->0:00:25.100000
 I had a blank conversation because they just said that somebody dropped out so I was just

1
0:00:25.100000-->0:00:29.160000
 looking at a connected window and I was thinking I hope it's not my laptop that's lost connection.

2
0:00:30.780000-->0:00:39.690000
 I was like, oh my god, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I

3
0:00:41.250000-->0:00:48.860000
 can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe

4
0:00:48.860000-->0:00:56.380000
 it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I

5
0:00:57.150000-->0:01:03.900000
 can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe it, I can't believe

6
0:01:09.670000-->0:01:09.770000
 it, I can't believe it.

7
0:01:09.770000-->0:01:18.120000
 I feel your pain, I broke my leg last year and the physiotherapy afterwards, it was like

8
0:01:18.120000-->0:01:19.600000
 you say, it's the motivation.

9
0:01:21.080000-->0:01:26.580000
 When you've been so immobile for so long, you kind of lose your motivation for most

10
0:01:26.580000-->0:01:27.280000
 things don't you?

11
0:01:27.280000-->0:01:32.540000
 But yeah, I think that was definitely the bit I struggled with, the physiotherapy afterwards.

12
0:01:33.680000-->0:01:46.260000
 Yeah, oh you'll get there, you'll get there.

13
0:01:53.340000-->0:01:55.580000
 Oh, oh bless you.

14
0:01:56.580000-->0:02:02.300000
 So you just want normality now don't you then, if you've been waiting such a long time.

15
0:02:02.300000-->0:02:05.180000
 Oh, where are you located you guys, since up north?

16
0:02:08.590000-->0:02:10.710000
 Oh no, it's cold there today isn't it?

17
0:02:10.710000-->0:02:26.650000
 Oh, oh no way, oh I couldn't do that, I could not, it's bad enough I went to go and get

18
0:02:26.650000-->0:02:31.290000
 the bins in this morning and even that I was like, oh god I'm not going out again today,

19
0:02:31.330000-->0:02:32.450000
 it's awful out there.

20
0:02:32.450000-->0:02:33.990000
 But yeah, it's all lifestyle.

21
0:02:34.330000-->0:02:38.130000
 No, no I don't, help yourself.

22
0:02:39.730000-->0:02:43.790000
 Oh wow, oh okay.

23
0:02:53.030000-->0:02:57.290000
 I bet she gets protected by her brothers, big brothers though doesn't she?

24
0:03:06.610000-->0:03:10.010000
 It's like most families, well I think it's most households these days aren't they, they're

25
0:03:10.010000-->0:03:11.730000
 all pretty much the same.

26
0:03:11.730000-->0:03:17.010000
 Yeah, I'm saying come from a broken family, so I think it was more normal to have a broken

27
0:03:17.010000-->0:03:19.730000
 family than it was to not when I was in school.

28
0:03:21.030000-->0:03:23.650000
 It's common these days isn't it?

29
0:03:29.500000-->0:03:30.380000
 Oh, how lucky.

30
0:03:38.540000-->0:03:38.980000
 On my hit list.

31
0:03:43.830000-->0:03:44.550000
 Yeah, yeah.

32
0:03:49.290000-->0:03:49.810000
 Oh nice.

33
0:03:56.170000-->0:03:56.190000
 Yeah.

34
0:03:58.650000-->0:04:04.460000
 Well it's lovely to meet you and enjoy the rest of your day and your recovery, I hope

35
0:04:04.460000-->0:04:05.120000
 it goes well.

36
0:04:06.160000-->0:04:06.560000
 Thank you.

37
0:04:07.360000-->0:04:09.080000
 Take care, keep warm.
