0:00:11.100000-->0:00:17.820000
 Hello, sorry, I'm mute.

1
0:00:17.900000-->0:00:30.750000
 The second one, the first one you couldn't hear me very well.

2
0:00:30.750000-->0:00:33.970000
 And then there seems to be an overlap.

3
0:00:33.970000-->0:00:40.270000
 And then the second one, basically, I could hardly hear her voice.

4
0:00:40.270000-->0:00:42.630000
 She was 100%, I was 100%.

5
0:00:42.750000-->0:00:46.250000
 Thankfully, the third one and this one, it's fine now.

6
0:00:46.750000-->0:00:50.830000
 So, I don't know if it's intentional, do you think?

7
0:00:56.600000-->0:00:57.740000
 Yeah, definitely.

8
0:00:57.740000-->0:00:59.700000
 So, whereabouts do you live?

9
0:01:02.450000-->0:01:04.840000
 Oh, right, okay, I'm in North Wales.

10
0:01:05.560000-->0:01:07.240000
 North Wales, just over the border.

11
0:01:07.240000-->0:01:12.920000
 So, yeah, basically five miles from Chester.

12
0:01:18.900000-->0:01:23.800000
 Yeah, that's about 10, 15 minutes from me, only.

13
0:01:23.900000-->0:01:26.280000
 Okay, cool.

14
0:01:26.280000-->0:01:28.160000
 Well, I'm originally from South Africa.

15
0:01:28.500000-->0:01:35.600000
 So, yeah, 2008 we moved.

16
0:01:36.500000-->0:01:38.420000
 There were various reasons.

17
0:01:38.500000-->0:01:44.780000
 Safety, having to have a car for everyone.

18
0:01:45.500000-->0:01:50.340000
 Yeah, it was just, and we have medical aid there, which, you know,

19
0:01:50.340000-->0:01:53.820000
 instead of the NHS, basically it's all private.

20
0:01:53.820000-->0:01:59.300000
 And I'm on medication, and my parents would have had to pay more.

21
0:01:59.300000-->0:02:04.340000
 And, yeah, it's kind of like, now, if we don't leave it all, it's like,

22
0:02:04.340000-->0:02:11.820000
 well, I mean, so, you know, being about 15, 16 years, yeah.

23
0:02:12.950000-->0:02:15.860000
 So, it's been a long time.

24
0:02:16.700000-->0:02:18.980000
 But, yeah, I don't know where the time went.

25
0:02:29.200000-->0:02:35.180000
 Oh, right, yeah, someone in our church, actually the pastor's daughter,

26
0:02:35.180000-->0:02:44.370000
 one of them, anyway, she actually worked in Manchester at Burberry

27
0:02:44.370000-->0:02:45.830000
 in Selfridges.

28
0:02:45.850000-->0:02:53.150000
 She actually quit her job in the last, well, mid-December,

29
0:02:53.450000-->0:03:01.370000
 because she studied fashion, and then she was, like,

30
0:03:01.370000-->0:03:07.070000
 she had to basically not look after, but, like,

31
0:03:07.070000-->0:03:10.910000
 she was head of a certain amount of people,

32
0:03:10.910000-->0:03:16.070000
 and then more pressure put on her somehow, and, like, no,

33
0:03:16.070000-->0:03:18.730000
 this is ridiculous, but enough's enough.

34
0:03:18.730000-->0:03:21.510000
 And she quit.

35
0:03:21.510000-->0:03:25.470000
 I think she's been there for six years or something.

36
0:03:25.470000-->0:03:29.630000
 So, yeah, looking for another job.

37
0:03:29.930000-->0:03:33.070000
 But she's still in Manchester because her boyfriend's there.

38
0:03:33.070000-->0:03:37.630000
 But, yeah, so, do you work then?

39
0:03:46.450000-->0:03:46.550000
 Yeah.

40
0:03:47.250000-->0:03:48.750000
 So, what do you do?

41
0:03:48.950000-->0:03:50.210000
 I don't know.

42
0:03:53.800000-->0:03:55.020000
 I don't know.

43
0:03:59.650000-->0:04:00.530000
 Interesting.

44
0:04:00.650000-->0:04:02.670000
 We're going to be cut off soon, by the way.

45
0:04:02.670000-->0:04:08.650000
 So, anyway, I don't have a job, so that's pretty much me.

46
0:04:08.650000-->0:04:09.910000
 Anyway, nice stuff.
