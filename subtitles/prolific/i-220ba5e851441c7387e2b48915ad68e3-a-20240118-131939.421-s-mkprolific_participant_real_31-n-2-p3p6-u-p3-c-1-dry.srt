7
0:01:29.050000-->0:02:00.160000
 you do in Ireland then yeah yeah yeah that is good yeah I do commodity

8
0:02:00.160000-->0:02:06.580000
 trading mostly that's what I do but it's like it takes a long long time to kind

9
0:02:06.580000-->0:02:10.800000
 of learn it well enough to be confident in it and everything and so yeah I just

10
0:02:10.800000-->0:02:15.580000
 do stuff like yeah oh it is tough but I do stuff like prolific just as like a

11
0:02:15.580000-->0:02:20.020000
 supplementary thing just because it can be so stressful when you're just sort of

12
0:02:20.020000-->0:02:23.640000
 like working with numbers and everything all day and then it's stuff

13
0:02:23.640000-->0:02:27.980000
 like this I'm like oh that's just fun banked that's like that's a nice little

14
0:02:27.980000-->0:02:45.050000
 addition to the day and it's a guarantee but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well yeah

15
0:02:45.050000-->0:02:49.690000
 it's like it's it's good and bad because you have a lot of volume that you can

16
0:02:49.690000-->0:02:55.410000
 then work with but you are it is like a bit of more unpredictable it's difficult

17
0:02:55.410000-->0:02:58.590000
 because you don't want it really slow moving you don't want it that the graphs

18
0:02:58.590000-->0:03:02.850000
 are like hardly going anywhere but at the same time you don't want it to be

19
0:03:02.850000-->0:03:09.530000
 that the economy is really bad so it is it is a difficult one but yeah that's

20
0:03:09.530000-->0:03:18.810000
 what I'm doing yeah yeah it does yeah and you can like you can predict what

21
0:03:18.810000-->0:03:21.290000
 something's gonna do and you can like draw it all out and you're like okay

22
0:03:21.290000-->0:03:24.710000
 this is what I think it's gonna happen and then a piece of news will come out

23
0:03:24.710000-->0:03:30.770000
 and just everything just shoots up or shoots down like and and so I haven't

24
0:03:30.770000-->0:03:37.160000
 really I've kind of been like I've kind of watched it before when I've been in a

25
0:03:37.160000-->0:03:42.180000
 trade and it's like shot up or shot down and it can sometimes be that you end up

26
0:03:42.180000-->0:03:47.740000
 like owing money because if it's gone so fast it's missed where you kind of put

27
0:03:47.740000-->0:03:52.220000
 your cut off and it just shoots down and then like it turns out that you owe like

28
0:03:52.220000-->0:03:58.260000
 Â£30 to the platform that you're using which is very stressful just makes

29
0:03:58.260000-->0:04:04.480000
 nothing worthwhile yeah yeah yeah it was good to meet you I hope you're staying
