0:00:11.450000-->0:00:11.830000
 Hello?

1
0:00:13.950000-->0:00:17.510000
 You can turn your volume up a bit, I think.

2
0:00:17.950000-->0:00:18.990000
 I can't quite hear you.

3
0:00:23.400000-->0:00:24.970000
 You're very faint.

4
0:00:24.970000-->0:00:26.800000
 Um...

5
0:00:27.260000-->0:00:28.560000
 Is your volume fully up?

6
0:00:31.100000-->0:00:33.380000
 Is it? Okay, um...

7
0:00:33.380000-->0:00:34.660000
 Can you hear me okay?

8
0:00:37.100000-->0:00:41.190000
 Yeah, okay. You're very faint, but I can just hear you.

9
0:00:41.530000-->0:00:42.670000
 How are you?

10
0:00:42.750000-->0:00:46.600000
 Good.

11
0:00:47.400000-->0:00:49.360000
 Whereabouts do you live?

12
0:00:55.600000-->0:00:57.850000
 Sorry, I didn't quite get that.

13
0:01:02.400000-->0:01:06.350000
 Oh, right. Okay, cool. I live in North Wales.

14
0:01:06.350000-->0:01:08.830000
 Just over the border from the English.

15
0:01:09.650000-->0:01:11.880000
 Have you heard of Chester?

16
0:01:14.500000-->0:01:20.420000
 Yeah, so about five or so miles from there, basically.

17
0:01:20.500000-->0:01:22.660000
 Not too far.

18
0:01:22.660000-->0:01:23.940000
 Yeah.

19
0:01:28.750000-->0:01:30.030000
 Oh, what? Sorry?

20
0:01:33.800000-->0:01:34.960000
 Oh, how did it go?

21
0:01:35.800000-->0:01:38.720000
 It was a bit, um...

22
0:01:39.450000-->0:01:41.940000
 I think there was a bit of a delay or something.

23
0:01:42.200000-->0:01:44.340000
 He couldn't quite hear me.

24
0:01:44.340000-->0:01:49.600000
 But I keep repeating, and then when he heard me,

25
0:01:49.600000-->0:01:52.120000
 and then he replied to me,

26
0:01:52.120000-->0:01:55.440000
 so it was a bit awkward, but, you know.

27
0:01:55.600000-->0:02:00.640000
 What's quite cool, though, was I'm originally from South Africa,

28
0:02:00.640000-->0:02:03.840000
 and he was from Nigeria,

29
0:02:03.840000-->0:02:06.080000
 and he moved over three years ago.

30
0:02:06.080000-->0:02:08.560000
 We moved 15, 16 years ago.

31
0:02:08.600000-->0:02:12.100000
 So, small world, as they say.

32
0:02:13.750000-->0:02:18.450000
 So, are you studying, or...?

33
0:02:27.190000-->0:02:28.590000
 Oh, okay, cool.

34
0:02:28.950000-->0:02:32.950000
 Oh, yeah, I haven't been working for a while.

35
0:02:33.950000-->0:02:40.310000
 I had health issues, so not able to work, really.

36
0:02:42.430000-->0:02:44.930000
 Don't know where the time's gone, though.

37
0:02:45.150000-->0:02:47.590000
 It just seems to disappear.

38
0:02:49-->0:02:51.200000
 It's like...

39
0:02:54.190000-->0:02:54.650000
 Sorry?

40
0:03:01.950000-->0:03:02.670000
 Yeah.

41
0:03:03.950000-->0:03:07.210000
 But it's like, it kind of feels like you're living as a pensioner.

42
0:03:09.950000-->0:03:12.930000
 You just kind of do whatever,

43
0:03:12.950000-->0:03:16.630000
 and you fill your days with other things,

44
0:03:16.950000-->0:03:18.890000
 and you kind of think,

45
0:03:18.950000-->0:03:21.650000
 if I hadn't got a job, I'd never be able to do all these things.

46
0:03:21.950000-->0:03:26.750000
 But, yeah, you're literally on one day,

47
0:03:26.750000-->0:03:28.670000
 and then you pretty much blink,

48
0:03:28.670000-->0:03:31.290000
 and it's the next week or something.

49
0:03:31.290000-->0:03:33.450000
 You're like, where did the week go?

50
0:03:34.250000-->0:03:38.130000
 So, yeah, it's just mad.

51
0:03:38.150000-->0:03:43.380000
 It's like, before I knew it, like, the last month has just flown by.

52
0:03:44.500000-->0:03:46.400000
 I don't know.

53
0:03:56.560000-->0:03:56.580000
 January.

54
0:03:56.900000-->0:04:01.650000
 Well, I guess it also starts getting lighter in February, doesn't it?

55
0:04:01.650000-->0:04:05.530000
 My mom was saying the other day, no, this morning,

56
0:04:05.530000-->0:04:09.430000
 that because she gets up quite early and it's getting lighter.
