 Hi, how are you? Yeah, I'm not bad. Thank you. This is a really strange like a task

1
0:00:31.250000-->0:00:42.760000
 I'm Amy. Nice to meet you. Whereabouts are you from? Oh, um, oh

2
0:00:50.150000-->0:00:55.730000
 Cool okay. Yeah, I'm in the UK as well. I'm sort of like Brighton so like right on the coast

3
0:00:56.500000-->0:00:57.350000
 Um

4
0:00:58.130000-->0:00:59.090000
 fun wise

5
0:01:00.850000-->0:01:05.240000
 That's a good question. Um, i've got a like quite a young dog

6
0:01:05.240000-->0:01:08.540000
 I don't know if I can still call him a puppy because he's like two now, but um

7
0:01:08.840000-->0:01:10.620000
 Yeah, i've got a dog. So

8
0:01:12.440000-->0:01:14.880000
 Two years. Yeah. Um

9
0:01:16.550000-->0:01:21.470000
 Yeah, yeah, he'll like always be a puppy in my eyes, but I know he's not

10
0:01:22.750000-->0:01:27.730000
 Um, so yeah, he takes a lot of my time like going out and stuff. What about you?

11
0:01:42.490000-->0:01:42.910000
 Oh

12
0:02:05.110000-->0:02:08.150000
 Yeah, yeah, I can relate to that. It's nice

13
0:02:08.190000-->0:02:11.690000
 being able to do prolific, you know from home and

14
0:02:11.790000-->0:02:15.250000
 And do things sometimes without having to to go up

15
0:02:17.820000-->0:02:18.360000
 Yeah

16
0:02:20.850000-->0:02:22.550000
 Yeah, yeah, I am

17
0:02:23.350000-->0:02:25.400000
 um, i'm doing uh

18
0:02:25.400000-->0:02:27.500000
 masters at the moment, so um

19
0:02:28.050000-->0:02:31.630000
 Yeah, it's nice having this to like fit in with it and earn a bit of money

20
0:02:36.270000-->0:02:43.230000
 Uh education, um, so I used to be a teacher but decided that I didn't want to do that anymore. So, um

21
0:02:43.390000-->0:02:48.090000
 Yeah, trying to like stay in that sector, but but do something different

22
0:02:53.650000-->0:02:58.920000
 Tough. Yeah, I mean I really enjoyed it, but but like the hours are really long

23
0:02:58.920000-->0:03:04.040000
 um, and I spent a lot of like evenings and weekends, you know, like preparing things and

24
0:03:04.900000-->0:03:09.040000
 So, uh, yeah, it was it was tough to leave but um

25
0:03:09.040000-->0:03:12.580000
 I'm hoping that I can kind of still stay in it somewhat

26
0:03:14.150000-->0:03:15.960000
 What about you? What do you um?

27
0:03:27.850000-->0:03:32.770000
 Oh, cool. Oh, well, I hope that that you managed to get enough money and can start it soon

28
0:03:45.430000-->0:03:48.150000
 Yeah, yeah, I think so, um

29
0:03:48.150000-->0:03:51.410000
 because it's like a really big statistic I think like

30
0:03:51.910000-->0:03:56.690000
 In the like first five years of qualifying like half of teachers leave or something. So, um

31
0:03:56.970000-->0:04:00.730000
 Yeah, they really need to do something to like sort the work-life balance out

32
0:04:03.090000-->0:04:03.450000
 but

33
0:04:03.790000-->0:04:06.170000
 Anyway, it was it was nice meeting you and good luck

34
0:04:07.050000-->0:04:08.650000
 Oh, she oh
