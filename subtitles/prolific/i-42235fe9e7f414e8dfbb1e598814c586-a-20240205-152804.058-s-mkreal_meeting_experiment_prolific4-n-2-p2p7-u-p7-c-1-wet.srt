0:00:48.370000-->0:00:55.400000
 I've done with camera so I've been doing yeah I've been doing the the other ones

4
0:00:55.400000-->0:01:00.260000

5
0:01:00.260000-->0:01:33

6
0:01:33-->0:01:40.610000

0:02:25.520000-->0:02:33.620000
 respond so quickly to a image and guess like just you had to use like really good

10
0:02:33.620000-->0:02:39.300000
 eye coordination and honestly I thought I was doing horribly to be honest but it

11
0:02:39.300000-->0:02:41.340000
 really was just it was quite engaging

12
0:03:18.350000-->0:03:26.070000
 yeah and a lot of them they just take 15 20 minutes and are very easy it's just

13
0:03:26.070000-->0:03:36.080000
 yeah just a little extra every month it helps yeah
