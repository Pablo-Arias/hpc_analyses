 Hello, how are you? Yeah, good, thank you. I've just come off a call, speaking. Oh, you

1
0:00:22.920000-->0:00:47.690000
 can, good. Oh, no. Oh, no. So you just sat there for four minutes in silence. Oh, no.

2
0:00:49.590000-->0:00:56.990000
 I'm in Preston. So surprisingly, the person I've just spoke with is from Preston as well,

3
0:00:56.990000-->0:01:03.750000
 which is so weird. So I wonder if they've grouped us. Whereabouts are you from? Okay,

4
0:01:03.750000-->0:01:11.560000
 so they've not grouped us on similar locations at all then. Yeah, it must be, that's strange.

5
0:01:11.560000-->0:01:27.890000
 Is it free to come and play with you as well? It's ice cold in here. Oh, God. Yeah, me too.

6
0:01:27.890000-->0:01:31.770000
 I mean, I try not to put it on too much if I'm at home on my own, just because there's

7
0:01:31.770000-->0:01:35.130000
 no point heating a whole house. But today, I've broken that rule. That heating's going

8
0:01:35.130000-->0:01:42.870000
 on just for me. No, no kids, just me and my little dog and then my boyfriend. Yeah,

9
0:01:42.870000-->0:01:59.270000
 what about you? There's no point. Oh, yeah, that's a good idea, actually. I might grab

10
0:01:59.270000-->0:02:06.070000
 one as well. How old is your little girl? Is she in school now then? Oh, so she's in school now.

11
0:02:13.030000-->0:02:18.560000
 Oh, God. Yeah, in September. Yeah, they grow up quickly, girls, don't they?

12
0:02:18.560000-->0:02:25.320000
 I've got, I think she's 15, 15-year-old niece, and she's grown up so quickly the past few years,

13
0:02:25.320000-->0:02:33.930000
 like as soon as she went to high school, different person. So be prepared. My sister's daughter,

14
0:02:33.930000-->0:02:43.620000
 yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, literally. I mean, I can even see it from her, just like her text to me

15
0:02:43.620000-->0:02:49.240000
 and what she's like. But it's funny because my boyfriend's got four brothers, similar age,

16
0:02:49.240000-->0:02:52.820000
 one of them, and they're so different, like girls and boys are so different.

17
0:03:08.650000-->0:03:13.700000
 Yeah, I think, do you know what? Everyone who's got a girl says the exact same thing.

18
0:03:14.900000-->0:03:19.280000
 But then if I was to choose, like if I was going to have kids, I'd want a girl.

19
0:03:19.280000-->0:03:24.060000
 So I don't know why. I don't know. I just want a little best friend.

20
0:03:24.360000-->0:03:28.630000
 Yeah, we're not cool enough for them anymore.

21
0:03:49.040000-->0:03:55.520000
 That's so funny. Oh, bless her. You're already starting to embarrass her.

22
0:04:00-->0:04:05.410000
 Lovely to meet you anyway, in case we get cut off any time. Not really.
