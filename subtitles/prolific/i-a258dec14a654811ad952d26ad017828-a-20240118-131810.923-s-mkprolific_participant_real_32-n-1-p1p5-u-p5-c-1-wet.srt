 Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. I'm not sure what we're supposed to talk about,

1
0:00:23.760000-->0:00:43.850000
 do you know? Okay. My name is Annette and I live in Exeter. What about you? Oh, wow.

2
0:00:43.850000-->0:00:50.110000
 Okay. So I've never been to Derbyshire. I think the northest I've been was to Sheffield.

3
0:00:50.110000-->0:00:57.460000
 It doesn't really count, I suppose. Oh no, the train goes through Derby, right? It goes Derby

4
0:00:57.460000-->0:01:21.570000
 and then it goes to Sheffield. I see, yeah. Do you enjoy living there? Okay. Wow. What kind of

5
0:01:21.570000-->0:01:40.530000
 dog do you have? I like dogs. I do have a cat. I'm a reformed dog person. Oh my god, that's amazing.

6
0:01:40.530000-->0:01:50.170000
 Is that a cat behind you? Nothing, you know. I thought I'd see something white sticking out

7
0:01:50.170000-->0:01:54.550000
 and I have a black and white cat, so she randomly sticks out of places.

8
0:02:01.150000-->0:02:04.610000
 Blessed. How did you end up with nine cats?

9
0:02:04.910000-->0:02:21.740000
 There we go. Yeah, that's amazing. I mean, I don't know how much you spend on the cat food,

10
0:02:23.100000-->0:02:27.260000
 but yeah, it's amazing to have them all around, I bet.

11
0:02:32.850000-->0:02:37.600000
 Blessed. Yeah, I sometimes wonder what they think, yeah.

12
0:02:37.600000-->0:02:38.100000
 Blessed. Yeah.

13
0:02:57.800000-->0:03:11.990000
 Aw, blessed. Yeah, blessed them. But it's a long time for a cat, 15 years. It's a long time,

14
0:03:11.990000-->0:03:12.890000
 so that was a good going.

15
0:03:15.490000-->0:03:24.570000
 Blessed them. Did you notice that they are kind of slower like people, like

16
0:03:25.650000-->0:03:30.510000
 kind of slower to move as they age, or not really, you know?

17
0:03:45.900000-->0:03:55.290000
 Aw, blessed. Aw, that's horrible. But then at least she thought she is fine up until the end,

18
0:04:00.550000-->0:04:01.430000
 so that's good. That's good for her. Okay, so we have, yeah, 15 seconds, so it was lovely to meet

19
0:04:05.950000-->0:04:07.350000
 you. I'm so happy to meet you. I'm so happy to meet you, I'm so happy to meet you, I'm so happy

20
0:04:07.350000-->0:04:09.470000
 to meet you, I'm so happy to meet you, I'm so happy to meet you.
