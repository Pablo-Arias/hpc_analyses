 Hello. Hi, I'm Zoe. Oh, good thanks. How are you? Yeah, good thanks. I think there's a

1
0:00:22.030000-->0:00:33.790000
 little bit of a lag, so sorry about that if it's a bit slow. Hi, nice to meet you. My

2
0:00:33.790000-->0:00:45.950000
 name's Zoe. Oh, do you? So, are you from the UK? Are you in the UK right now, or whereabouts

3
0:00:45.950000-->0:00:58.230000
 in the world are you? Oh, cool. Whereabouts? No way, I'm literally in Preston as well.

4
0:01:00.750000-->0:01:09.390000
 That's so strange. I won't ask you whereabouts, because we'll keep it anonymous, I think.

5
0:01:09.390000-->0:01:17.850000
 But yeah, just in case. It's freezing today, isn't it? It's so cold. I've just been out

6
0:01:17.850000-->0:01:28.310000
 to walk my dog, so it's really icy out there. He's a red fox labrador, like a labrador retriever.

7
0:01:28.310000-->0:01:59.540000
 He's really cute. Yeah. Oh, you're scared of them? Oh, how come? Oh, I'm sure if you

8
0:01:59.540000-->0:02:14.720000
 met the right dogs, it would make you relax a little bit around them. Yeah, it might be

9
0:02:14.720000-->0:02:20.900000
 a little bit difficult if you can't touch them looking after them. If you could get

10
0:02:20.900000-->0:02:37.220000
 a dog, what one would you get? Oh, a little one, a little yappy one. Yeah, they are like

11
0:02:37.220000-->0:02:52.660000
 little best friends. They're amazing. Yeah, they're so good. Have you got any other pets

12
0:02:52.660000-->0:03:20.300000
 or anything? No, nothing. A tortoise. That's so cool. Don't they live for ages? Oh, that's

13
0:03:21.390000-->0:03:46.510000
 cute. Are they really slow or do they actually go quite fast? Oh, that sounds cute. What

14
0:03:46.510000-->0:04:04.600000
 was its name? If it was a boy or a girl? Alan? Oh, I think we're about to end, but it was

15
0:04:04.600000-->0:04:06.480000
 nice to meet you anyway. Enjoy the rest of your day.
