0:00:13.250000-->0:00:30.280000
 There's a little bit of a delay, isn't there? So, this is weird. Do we just need to say

1
0:00:30.280000-->0:00:42.550000
 who we are and everything? Yes. Oh, is it? Yeah, I did. I saw a woman. Actually, four

2
0:00:42.550000-->0:00:52.340000
 minutes goes in no time. So, whereabouts do you live? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What made you move

3
0:00:52.340000-->0:01:13.980000
 to Wales? Oh, great. Is it nice? Do you like Wales? Yeah, it is a bit. Yeah, no, I'm in

4
0:01:13.980000-->0:01:23.670000
 South London and it's sunny and mild at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well, it makes it

5
0:01:23.670000-->0:01:34.200000
 green, doesn't it? Uh-huh. Well, sure. Yeah, I've got a garden as well. I've also got a

6
0:01:34.200000-->0:01:41.360000
 very active dog. So, I spend a lot of time outdoors generally, you know, two, three hours

7
0:01:41.360000-->0:01:50.200000
 a day walking the blooming dog. So, yeah. Yeah. It's nice. It keeps me outside and

8
0:01:50.200000-->0:01:57.060000
 walking and everything. How about you? Do you work? Have you got family or working or what?

9
0:01:57.480000-->0:02:13.530000
 Oh, right, right. Oh, do you? Yeah, yeah. And do you like? No. Do you like doing that? Yeah.

10
0:02:20.500000-->0:02:35.250000
 When you say a little garden, is it really quite big? Uh-huh. Oh, well, that sounds nice. That's

11
0:02:35.250000-->0:02:43.630000
 something I'd like a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, excellent. Well, I grew up in Croydon, which

12
0:02:43.630000-->0:02:50.450000
 is South London-ish. And then I went away to university and stuff. But I somehow landed back

13
0:02:50.450000-->0:02:55.990000
 in South London. I would quite like to leave London, but it can be quite hard. You can get

14
0:02:55.990000-->0:03:01.690000
 stuck here. And there are so many advantages and so many disadvantages. So, every time you think,

15
0:03:01.690000-->0:03:13.990000
 oh, I want to leave London, you think of all the good things about it. Oh, yeah. That's not

16
0:03:13.990000-->0:03:26.560000
 far from me. It's, I don't know, a few miles, half an hour on the train, you know. No. Really?

17
0:03:26.560000-->0:03:35
 Yeah. Well, it used to be for me, but I think it changes as you get older anyway. You know,

18
0:03:35-->0:03:41.540000
 you just want a quieter life. The idea of having a couple of acres of land just sounds fab to me.

19
0:03:41.540000-->0:03:55.860000
 Absolutely fabulous. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, that's wonderful. Yeah. And oh, I'm getting

20
0:03:55.860000-->0:04:02.780000
 flashed. Conversation over in 15 seconds. Yeah, it does go quickly, doesn't it? Yeah.

21
0:04:04.300000-->0:04:08.300000
 Get some walnut trees in as well. Nut trees. Fabulous.
