 Hi. Hi. I'm good, thank you. How are you? Oh my gosh, same. It's been such a long week.

1
0:00:23.480000-->0:00:49.520000
 I bet it's about to be over. Oh my gosh. Oh, I've been dropped off. Oh, that's annoying.

2
0:00:51.900000-->0:01:02.580000
 Oh, that's so annoying. Same. Like, I saw the little intro saying, oh, it's about how

3
0:01:02.580000-->0:01:31.320000
 people talk to each other, but I bet that's not the full story. Like, yeah. Like, just

4
0:01:31.320000-->0:01:35.320000
 making small talk with other people is like the whole point of the experiment. It's kind

5
0:01:35.320000-->0:01:50.220000
 of confusing. I'm just staring at each other the whole time. Oh my gosh, that really sucks.

6
0:01:54.500000-->0:01:59.480000
 Yeah, the people watching it back afterwards just being like, ah, yeah, that was a complete

7
0:01:59.480000-->0:02:27.700000
 fail. Did all your conversations go fine before this? One of my people dropped out. Oh, really?

8
0:02:47.300000-->0:02:55.250000
 Yeah. Honestly, I'm going to be resting, but also cleaning, because our landlord is having

9
0:02:55.250000-->0:03:01.430000
 people replace all the windows, so I need to, like, deep clean the entire house, which

10
0:03:01.430000-->0:03:12.650000
 is a pain. Yeah. I live with my mother, actually, and we rent from a landlord. I've lived here

11
0:03:12.650000-->0:03:36.090000
 all my life, though, so same landlord. Easy. Do you have any plans? Your cat has her own

12
0:03:36.250000-->0:03:47.120000
 plans. Yeah. My friend has a cat. Yeah, every time she tells me about a cat, I'm like, wow,

13
0:03:47.120000-->0:04:06.040000
 your cat really is the queen of the house. She wants it. What, you're just doing nothing

14
0:04:06.300000-->0:04:09.280000
 and looking over you like, what are you doing, actually?
