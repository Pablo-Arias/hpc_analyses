 Hi, sorry, it keeps on disconnecting.

1
0:00:11.450000-->0:00:12.970000
 Is it just me or you?

2
0:00:12.970000-->0:00:14.830000
 You're disconnected too.

3
0:00:16.850000-->0:00:19.210000
 I don't know what's going on.

4
0:00:19.210000-->0:00:21.670000
 It's normally, internet is normally very good.

5
0:00:21.670000-->0:00:29.850000
 Sorry about that. Yeah, we also have a cousin.

6
0:00:29.850000-->0:00:31.790000
 A cousin of my husband is visiting.

7
0:00:31.790000-->0:00:35.050000
 So yeah, so we're just going to hang out with him and go

8
0:00:35.050000-->0:00:37.870000
 out on walks with the dogs and so on.

9
0:00:37.910000-->0:00:40.230000
 So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

10
0:00:42.540000-->0:00:46.420000
 I have to, I have one Cocker Spaniel mix

11
0:00:46.420000-->0:00:48.240000
 and the other is a Spring of Spaniel mix.

12
0:00:48.240000-->0:00:52.160000
 So they're very active and they really enjoy long, long walks.

13
0:01:02.640000-->0:01:04.600000
 Yeah, I like to play with those too.

14
0:01:04.920000-->0:01:08.480000
 Although now, end of the winter, everything is so muddy.

15
0:01:08.480000-->0:01:12
 The bigger the mess they make.

16
0:01:12-->0:01:14.240000
 So you always have to kind of wash them when,

17
0:01:14.560000-->0:01:16.640000
 but what can you do?

18
0:01:16.640000-->0:01:18.540000
 I mean, we let them on the furniture.

19
0:01:18.540000-->0:01:19.840000
 So you have to wash them.

20
0:01:19.840000-->0:01:21.340000
 Otherwise everything gets muddy.

21
0:01:22.660000-->0:01:23.040000
 Yeah.
