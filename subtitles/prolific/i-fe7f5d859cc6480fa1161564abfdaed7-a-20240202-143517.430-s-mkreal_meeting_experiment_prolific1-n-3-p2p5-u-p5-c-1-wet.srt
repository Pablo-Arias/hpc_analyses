 Hiya. Hi. How are you doing? This is an awkward situation, isn't it? Really? Well, that's

1
0:00:32.340000-->0:00:37.080000
 what the last woman I spoke to said. She hadn't done the first one either. No, I'm here. I

2
0:00:37.080000-->0:00:48.310000
 want me three quid or whatever it is. So whereabouts are you speaking from? Oh, you're in Devon.

3
0:00:48.310000-->0:00:57.930000
 Oh, God, nice. Yeah, I'm in South London, but... Sorry? Oh, did you? Yeah, that's not

4
0:00:57.930000-->0:01:04.890000
 far away at all. No, I'm thinking I would like to leave London, but every time I think

5
0:01:04.890000-->0:01:09.690000
 that, I think about all the good things about London and all the stuff there is to do. Whereabouts

6
0:01:09.690000-->0:01:28.470000
 in Devon are you? Oh, vaguely, yes. Yeah, yeah, vaguely. Is it nice? Yeah. Do you? Yeah.

7
0:01:28.530000-->0:01:52.220000
 What sort of things do you miss? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm allowed to say,

8
0:01:52.220000-->0:01:56.680000
 but the last person I spoke to was talking from Wales and she said the same thing. It's

9
0:01:56.680000-->0:02:09.900000
 very quiet here, you know, and I suppose that's why people move there, isn't it? Uh-huh. Yeah.

10
0:02:10.860000-->0:02:20.980000
 So how many kids have you got? Uh-huh. What sort of ages? So you're busy, aren't you?

11
0:02:22.280000-->0:02:29.960000
 Yeah, God. No, I have no children. I've got a very active border collie, so she keeps

12
0:02:29.960000-->0:02:34.820000
 me going. So I'm outside a lot. I'm either out in the garden or I'm out on the local

13
0:02:34.820000-->0:02:39.400000
 common walking the dog, and I've made friends there. We sit and have coffee, the dogs play,

14
0:02:39.400000-->0:02:44.640000
 so it's all quite nice. It's very much easier than having a five-year-old and an eight-year-old

15
0:02:44.640000-->0:02:57.060000
 child. It's all very relaxed and civilised, actually. So she is hard working away. Yeah,

16
0:02:57.060000-->0:03:05.920000
 I mean, a border collie, she needs her two walks a day, you know, but she's a lovely girl most of

17
0:03:05.920000-->0:03:17.600000
 the time. She's called Billy, but Billy the girl. She wouldn't suit a girly name. She's not a girly

18
0:03:17.600000-->0:03:41.050000
 dog. So how long have you been in Devon then? When did you move down? Oh, right. Uh-huh. Did

19
0:03:41.050000-->0:03:52.250000
 you move back because you had the kids? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a nicer place for them

20
0:03:52.250000-->0:04:02.310000
 to grow up as well, isn't it? Conversation over. Yes, I know. It goes very quickly.

21
0:04:02.610000-->0:04:07.610000
 Yes, thank you. Yeah, doesn't it just? It's a funny situation.
