0:00:00-->0:00:18.090000
 Hey! Oh, can you hear me? Oh, brilliant. Yeah, I can. Luckily, you're only the second person.

1
0:00:18.090000-->0:00:27.200000
 There were a lot of technical problems at the beginning. Yeah, the first person, she couldn't hear me and couldn't connect.

2
0:00:27.200000-->0:00:29.440000
 Then I got a big white screen for ages and nothing happened.

3
0:00:32.080000-->0:00:32.280000
 And the third person came and that just about worked.

4
0:00:32.280000-->0:00:35.080000
 So, yeah, I don't know who we're supposed to be talking to.

5
0:00:35.100000-->0:00:39.080000
 I don't know why some of it works and some of it doesn't.

6
0:00:40.590000-->0:00:44.010000
 But anyway, nice to see you.

7
0:00:44.010000-->0:00:48.580000
 And whereabouts are you in the world? Where do you live?

8
0:00:48.580000-->0:00:56.580000
 Brentwood. Oh, right. I'm near Brentford, which is in London, Brentford.

9
0:01:04.210000-->0:01:04.610000
 Have you had a nice day? Did you have a nice weekend? Did you do anything nice?

10
0:01:11.880000-->0:01:12.040000
 What's nice in Brentwood? What's nice in Brentwood?

11
0:01:14.880000-->0:01:14.940000
 Oh, that's nice.

12
0:01:16.480000-->0:01:16.880000
 Oh, I don't know.

13
0:01:22.530000-->0:01:23.500000
 I don't know.

14
0:01:34.120000-->0:01:34.840000
 I don't know.

15
0:01:38.580000-->0:01:38.640000
 I don't know.

16
0:01:42.720000-->0:01:42.960000
 I don't know.

17
0:01:42.960000-->0:01:46.100000
 Oh, that's nice.

18
0:01:59.700000-->0:02:03.180000
 Yeah, I've never been, but it's worth checking out.

19
0:02:03.180000-->0:02:07.680000
 I went up to near Manchester to see some old school friends.

20
0:02:07.680000-->0:02:12.340000
 There was a party and luckily I got there because there was a train strike on Saturday,

21
0:02:12.340000-->0:02:17.320000
 but got up on Friday and saw some elderly aunts of mine that I've not seen for a while.

22
0:02:17.320000-->0:02:19.380000
 It would be the last time I see them.

23
0:02:19.380000-->0:02:22.640000
 So it's nice to see them. And then Saturday was just great.

24
0:02:22.640000-->0:02:24.080000
 It was a really good party.

25
0:02:24.080000-->0:02:29.180000
 And my friend, an old school friend, and she had all her family and friends from all over.

26
0:02:29.180000-->0:02:31.060000
 And it was major. It was great fun.

27
0:02:31.060000-->0:02:34.680000
 It was a real disco and everyone was having a really good time.

28
0:02:34.680000-->0:02:39.320000
 But on Sunday I was aching all over because I was thinking, oh, I'm not 21 anymore.

29
0:02:39.700000-->0:02:44.860000
 I've got to remember, the spirit's strong, but the body's weak.

30
0:02:44.860000-->0:02:47.920000
 But it was good fun. It was nice.

31
0:02:47.920000-->0:02:51.680000
 It's nice to do things like that every now and then.

32
0:02:51.680000-->0:02:54.780000
 It's like, yeah, I do something a bit different.

33
0:02:56.190000-->0:02:59.530000
 How long was it? Oh, yeah, I think it's about eight months, I think.

34
0:02:59.530000-->0:03:02.310000
 I try to work it out. I do lots of services.

35
0:03:02.310000-->0:03:06.670000
 I was just talking to the last chap and some of them are really interesting and some of them are not so.

36
0:03:06.670000-->0:03:09.410000
 And all the best ones usually get snapped up.

37
0:03:09.410000-->0:03:12.830000
 I mean, I like these sorts of video ones because they're a bit different, aren't they?

38
0:03:12.830000-->0:03:16.970000
 But all the good ones get snapped up very quickly.

39
0:03:17.550000-->0:03:23.470000
 Most of them are worth 10. Yeah, lots of them are worth like 10 B or whatever.

40
0:03:23.470000-->0:03:26.170000
 But it's good. It's just interesting to do.

41
0:03:26.170000-->0:03:29.090000
 They make you think about things sometimes, don't they?

42
0:03:29.090000-->0:03:31.530000
 But I was saying I love them.

43
0:03:31.530000-->0:03:36.530000
 They're training AI, artificial intelligence, and it's kind of like lots of chatbots.

44
0:03:36.530000-->0:03:42.350000
 And that scares me a bit. I don't want to be training more human.

45
0:03:42.550000-->0:03:47.230000
 Like we're going to lose all our jobs and everything and robots will take over.

46
0:03:47.550000-->0:03:57.060000
 Yeah. When you're dealing with them online, is it efficient?

47
0:03:59.200000-->0:04:01.980000
 Oh, I'm Anne-Marie and you are?

48
0:04:09.280000-->0:04:09.360000
 Yeah, I like that.

49
0:04:09.360000-->0:04:09.740000
 Oh, fabulous.
