0:00:10.350000-->0:00:17.960000
 Hello, hello. I can't hear you. Yeah, I can hear you. I can try to crank you up a bit.

1
0:00:17.960000-->0:00:25.940000
 Oh, you are cranked up. OK, that's it then. OK, thank you. So my name is Annette and I'm

2
0:00:25.940000-->0:00:38.370000
 from Exeter. What about you? Oh wow, amazing. Yeah, I know it's like straight line all across

3
0:00:38.370000-->0:00:45.250000
 the country. I actually applied to study at the University of Aberdeen, but they didn't take me.

4
0:00:46.350000-->0:00:47.630000
 Their loss.

5
0:00:59-->0:01:06.330000
 Yeah, maybe, maybe. Who knows what you do? Yeah, I know. I researched. I looked into it. I was

6
0:01:06.330000-->0:01:10.190000
 like, oh, that's really nice. It's kind of small and the uni looked really good. The course

7
0:01:10.190000-->0:01:16.510000
 looked really good. Aberdeen was my preferred option. That's the uni I wanted to go to.

8
0:01:16.510000-->0:01:20.910000
 So when someone says Aberdeen, I'll be like, oh, I wanted to go there.

9
0:01:22.090000-->0:01:29.710000
 But hey, one day I'll get there. I went to Exeter. Yeah, so I went to Exeter. So yeah,

10
0:01:29.710000-->0:01:34.170000
 I moved here for uni and then just stayed here. I think it's quite common, isn't it,

11
0:01:34.170000-->0:01:42.370000
 for people to just get stuck in one place as a result of their uni adventures. What about you?

12
0:01:42.370000-->0:01:57.270000
 Where did you study? What did you study? Oh, wow. Amazing. Oh, wow.

13
0:01:58.610000-->0:02:03.490000
 Yeah, I was like, are you treating seals in the hospital?

14
0:02:09.410000-->0:02:09.430000
 Yeah.

15
0:02:24.190000-->0:02:28.410000
 I mean, NHS is good, isn't it, because you get the NHS pension, right?

16
0:02:29.600000-->0:02:37.450000
 Yeah, that's good. Yeah, well, twists and roundabouts, isn't it?

17
0:02:37.570000-->0:02:47.480000
 Yeah. So I work for Sustainability Consultancy, based in London. So I work from home and I'm

18
0:02:47.480000-->0:02:51.980000
 spending my lunch breaks like this, as you can see, talking to strangers on the internet.

19
0:02:57.750000-->0:03:01.160000
 Yeah, it's just like talk to people, right? Okay.

20
0:03:01.160000-->0:03:06.040000
 A bit random. I thought it was going to be like more instructions there, but no.

21
0:03:10.200000-->0:03:28.270000
 Yeah, that's really good. Okay. The same. The same. To be fair, because I've been doing things

22
0:03:28.270000-->0:03:35.570000
 like that during uni, since uni, and I feel like it's mostly like women that like participate in

23
0:03:35.570000-->0:03:42.570000
 things like that, whether that's just we are led to be more chattier, or we're led to be more kind

24
0:03:42.570000-->0:03:48.230000
 of volunteering spirited. I don't know, but there is definitely something going on there.

25
0:03:52.400000-->0:04:03.030000
 Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Well, gender norms. Hopefully, someone will define gender norms. I

26
0:04:03.030000-->0:04:05.210000
 will speak to a man as well for diversity.
