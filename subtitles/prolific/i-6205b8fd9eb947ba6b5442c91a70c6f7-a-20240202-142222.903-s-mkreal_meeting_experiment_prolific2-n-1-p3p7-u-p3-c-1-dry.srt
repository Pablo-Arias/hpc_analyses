 Hi.

1
0:00:14.390000-->0:00:14.410000
 Hi.

2
0:00:14.410000-->0:00:18.080000
 Naima, it's nice to meet you.

3
0:00:24.240000-->0:00:24.600000
 No.

4
0:00:27.760000-->0:00:27.880000
 Have you?

5
0:00:43.860000-->0:00:46.020000
 The puzzle sounds so fun, I would actually be down.

6
0:01:12-->0:01:12.220000
 Yeah.

7
0:01:16.530000-->0:01:16.550000
 No.

8
0:01:16.550000-->0:01:21.270000
 No, that sounds so fun.

9
0:01:33.480000-->0:01:33.540000
 I'm in Manchester.

10
0:01:33.800000-->0:01:34.200000
 Yeah.

11
0:01:42.650000-->0:01:46.870000
 No, so I'm from Canada, but I got married and my husband's from here, so we're here

12
0:01:46.870000-->0:01:47.110000
 now.

13
0:01:51.780000-->0:01:51.820000
 I do.

14
0:01:52.780000-->0:01:52.840000
 It's very lively.

15
0:01:52.840000-->0:01:58.740000
 So I'm from a smaller city in Canada, so it's not like Toronto or anything like that.

16
0:01:58.740000-->0:01:59.360000
 It's much smaller.

17
0:01:59.360000-->0:02:03.160000
 So being in Manchester, seeing people kind of like out and about all the time, I love

18
0:02:07.830000-->0:02:07.850000
 it.

19
0:02:07.850000-->0:02:08.390000
 No, no, no.

20
0:02:08.390000-->0:02:15.050000
 So I grew up in the Toronto area, but when I was about 16, we moved to Edmonton, if you've

21
0:02:15.050000-->0:02:15.510000
 heard of it.

22
0:02:15.510000-->0:02:17.190000
 If you watch hockey, you might know it.

23
0:02:22.350000-->0:02:22.510000
 Yeah, it is.

24
0:02:23.470000-->0:02:23.510000
 I know.

25
0:02:24.600000-->0:02:25.080000
 I don't know.

26
0:02:25.080000-->0:02:26.050000
 I don't think I do.

27
0:02:27.460000-->0:02:28.040000
 Don't get me wrong.

28
0:02:32.250000-->0:02:32.470000
 I think the UK is great.

29
0:02:32.470000-->0:02:33.150000
 It's got a lot to offer.

30
0:02:38.810000-->0:02:45.580000
 I just think for us, we're a younger couple trying to sort of start our life and buy a

31
0:02:45.580000-->0:02:48.740000
 house and like all of these things, and I just think it's so unaffordable here.

32
0:02:48.760000-->0:02:50.320000
 Like even being in Manchester.

33
0:02:50.320000-->0:02:50.580000
 Moving to Canada for sure.

34
0:03:11.350000-->0:03:12.830000
 Oh, I believe that, but that's in Toronto.

35
0:03:13.370000-->0:03:18.350000
 So I think it also depends on like what kind of mortgage you get, like if you get like

36
0:03:18.350000-->0:03:20.230000
 a fixed mortgage and like that sort of thing.

37
0:03:20.450000-->0:03:25.190000
 So had they gotten a fixed term probably earlier when it was quite low, then, you know, they

38
0:03:25.190000-->0:03:28.510000
 probably would have been fine, but that's pretty unfortunate.

39
0:03:30.640000-->0:03:35.340000
 No, in general, though, I would say that like if you have like a dream house that you want

40
0:03:35.340000-->0:03:40.260000
 to get built, like for me, I watched my parents build, you know, get a builder to like build

41
0:03:40.260000-->0:03:43.140000
 their house and like design the cabinets and like everything.

42
0:03:43.200000-->0:03:46.020000
 I just think that's so hard to do here.

43
0:03:56.990000-->0:03:57.730000
 It's ridiculous.

44
0:03:58.980000-->0:03:59.320000
 Yeah.

45
0:03:59.340000-->0:04:05.260000
 Well, and the incomes don't change.

46
0:04:06.020000-->0:04:06.260000
 Yeah.
