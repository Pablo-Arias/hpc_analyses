 Hi.

1
0:00:23.130000-->0:00:23.590000
 Can you hear me now?

2
0:00:27.820000-->0:00:28.300000
 It's not very clear, right?

3
0:00:36.130000-->0:00:36.850000
 I guess it's my headphones.

4
0:00:37.830000-->0:00:37.870000
 I'm sorry.

5
0:00:37.870000-->0:00:42.450000
 I apologize because it seems like everybody's having a similar issue.

6
0:00:45.700000-->0:00:46.220000
 How are you doing?

7
0:00:50.510000-->0:00:51.050000
 Great, great.

8
0:00:51.050000-->0:00:58.690000
 It's the first time I'm seeing a black person, so I feel much, or would I say better, talking

9
0:00:58.690000-->0:01:01.210000
 to someone who is more familiar.

10
0:01:01.210000-->0:01:01.500000
 Yeah.

11
0:01:03.700000-->0:01:11.120000
 Is this the first time you're doing video conference?

12
0:01:14.900000-->0:01:15.600000
 Ah, okay.

13
0:01:16.550000-->0:01:18.790000
 This is my second or third.

14
0:01:19.430000-->0:01:20.530000
 It usually gets...

15
0:01:20.530000-->0:01:21.890000
 I have to be like...

16
0:01:22.800000-->0:01:27.440000
 Because I'm not sure how it works, but then it is what it is.

17
0:01:27.440000-->0:01:29.560000
 Yeah.

18
0:01:31.300000-->0:01:35.340000
 So, my sister, you have to do that.

19
0:01:36-->0:01:39.160000
 So, why do you do Prolific?

20
0:01:39.160000-->0:01:39.960000
 I'm Igbo.

21
0:01:44.050000-->0:01:45.710000
 Anambra, what about you?

22
0:01:56.300000-->0:02:02.780000
 There's some people who take it as a bad compliment, but that's cool.

23
0:02:02.780000-->0:02:05.640000
 You look very Igbo.

24
0:02:08.560000-->0:02:08.780000
 Really?

25
0:02:08.780000-->0:02:09.340000
 Honestly?

26
0:02:12.940000-->0:02:13.080000
 Okay.

27
0:02:14.380000-->0:02:14.420000
 Praise God.

28
0:02:14.420000-->0:02:15.300000
 We try.

29
0:02:15.300000-->0:02:15.840000
 But then, that is cool.

30
0:02:17.380000-->0:02:17.500000
 So, why do you do Prolific?

31
0:02:17.500000-->0:02:19.300000
 I know, right.

32
0:02:23.380000-->0:02:23.400000
 Yeah.

33
0:02:24.830000-->0:02:24.870000
 Likewise, likewise.

34
0:02:25.830000-->0:02:25.870000
 Nothing yet.

35
0:02:25.870000-->0:02:25.990000
 I'm still schooling.

36
0:02:27.150000-->0:02:28.980000
 So, my part-time job is, so when I'm free...

37
0:02:38.380000-->0:02:38.540000
 Do you see this filter on your phone?

38
0:02:38.540000-->0:02:41.380000
 Is similar to the...

39
0:03:00.560000-->0:03:01.620000
 No, it's not like it's a filter.

40
0:03:01.620000-->0:03:06.640000
 like your your smile is over exaggerated, I guess so.

41
0:03:10.500000-->0:03:12.580000
 Yeah, I used to be very sick.

42
0:03:14.940000-->0:03:18.920000
 Do I see in cardiovascular rehab,

43
0:03:18.920000-->0:03:21.060000
 when I was in Nigeria I was a physiotherapist.

44
0:03:21.500000-->0:03:30.340000
 So, I'm just, cardiovascular rehabilitation, yeah.

45
0:03:32.350000-->0:03:36.940000
 I was a physio, yeah, or I'm still a physio.

46
0:03:38.600000-->0:03:45.220000
 So, it's just we are patients with cardiac condition, yeah.

47
0:03:45.220000-->0:03:48.200000
 Heart disease, lung disease.

48
0:03:50.440000-->0:03:51.580000
 Baba, what did you?

49
0:04:09.660000-->0:04:09.900000
 Yeah.
