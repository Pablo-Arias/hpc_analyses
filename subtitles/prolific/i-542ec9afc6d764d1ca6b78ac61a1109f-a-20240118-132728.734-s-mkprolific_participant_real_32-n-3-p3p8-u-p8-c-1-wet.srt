0:00:10.950000-->0:00:21.900000
 Hi, how are you? Yeah, I'm not bad. Thank you. This is a really strange like a task

1
0:00:31.250000-->0:00:42.770000
 I'm Amy. Nice to meet you. Whereabouts are you from? Oh, um, oh

2
0:00:50.140000-->0:00:55.680000
 Cool okay. Yeah, I'm in the UK as well. I'm sort of like Brighton so like right on the coast

3
0:00:58.140000-->0:00:59.040000
 Fun wise

4
0:01:00.850000-->0:01:05.210000
 That's a good question. Um, I've got like quite a young dog

5
0:01:05.210000-->0:01:08.530000
 I don't know if I can still call him a puppy because he's like two now, but um

6
0:01:08.570000-->0:01:10.550000
 Yeah, I've got a dog. So

7
0:01:12.400000-->0:01:13.800000
 Two years. Yeah

8
0:01:16.500000-->0:01:21.450000
 Yeah, yeah, he'll like always be a puppy in my eyes, but I know he's not

9
0:01:23.010000-->0:01:27.730000
 So, yeah, he takes a lot of my time like going out and stuff what about you

10
0:02:04.800000-->0:02:11.660000
 Yeah, yeah, I can relate to that it's nice being able to do prolific, you know from home and

11
0:02:11.660000-->0:02:15.020000
 Do things sometimes without having to go

12
0:02:17.790000-->0:02:18.350000
 Yeah

13
0:02:20.990000-->0:02:22.510000
 Yeah. Yeah, I am

14
0:02:23.320000-->0:02:24.960000
 I'm doing

15
0:02:25.160000-->0:02:27.460000
 Masters at the moment. So, um

16
0:02:28-->0:02:31.610000
 Yeah, it's nice having this to like fit in with it and earn a bit of money

17
0:02:36.250000-->0:02:37.670000
 Education

18
0:02:37.890000-->0:02:43.190000
 So I used to be a teacher but decided that I didn't want to do that anymore. So I'm

19
0:02:43.190000-->0:02:48.090000
 Yeah, trying to like stay in that sector, but but do something different

20
0:02:53.650000-->0:02:58.900000
 Tough. Yeah, I mean, I really enjoyed it. But they're like that hours are really long

21
0:02:58.960000-->0:03:03.620000
 And I spent a lot of like evenings and weekends, you know, like preparing things

22
0:03:03.620000-->0:03:11.510000
 So, yeah, it was it was tough to leave but um, I'm hoping that I can kind of still stay in it somewhat

23
0:03:14.590000-->0:03:15.310000
 What about you? What do you?

24
0:03:27.990000-->0:03:28.010000
 Oh

25
0:03:28.010000-->0:03:31.610000
 Well, I hope that that you managed to get enough money and can start it soon

26
0:03:45.680000-->0:03:46.380000
 Yeah, yeah, I think so

27
0:03:48.680000-->0:03:49.600000
 Because it's like a really big statistic

28
0:03:49.600000-->0:03:55.040000
 I think like in the like first five years of qualifying like half of teachers leave or something

29
0:03:57.620000-->0:03:58.720000
 Yeah, they really need to do something to like sort the work-life balance out

30
0:04:03.140000-->0:04:04.760000
 But anyway, it was nice meeting you and good luck. Oh

31
0:04:07.800000-->0:04:07.820000
