 Hiya, you alright? Yeah, you too. What's your name? Claire. Where are you about to see the

1
0:00:28.650000-->0:00:41.040000
 country are you from? Pardon? Yeah, I'm from Derbyshire. It's right in the middle of the

2
0:00:41.040000-->0:00:48.290000
 country. Oh, yeah, it's in the middle. Yeah, it's not. I don't think it's far. It's in

3
0:00:48.290000-->0:01:03.120000
 the Midlands, Derbyshire. It's a really big county. It's one of the big, I think it's

4
0:01:03.120000-->0:01:13.240000
 one of the biggest counties in the country other than London. I think. Yeah, it's just

5
0:01:13.680000-->0:01:20
 just below Yorkshire between Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. It's right in the middle.

6
0:01:30.300000-->0:01:39.140000
 Yeah. Yeah, it's just I live just about 20 minutes from Derby. So,

7
0:01:39.440000-->0:01:45.840000
 but I'm I'm more in the countryside. So in the middle of nowhere.

8
0:01:45.840000-->0:01:58.390000
 Yeah, it is some beautiful places if you like walking and it's really quiet where I live.

9
0:02:00.120000-->0:02:03.080000
 It was minus six this morning when my son got up for school.

10
0:02:08.620000-->0:02:10.200000
 Yeah, me too.

11
0:02:11.250000-->0:02:31.760000
 And where I live, it's really quiet. I think more people are friendlier than they are in

12
0:02:31.760000-->0:02:40.450000
 London from what I've heard. And people have weird accents where I'm from. Nobody can understand what

13
0:02:40.450000-->0:02:48.110000
 we say. Yeah, but mine's not a really broad accent because I've lived I've lived up north.

14
0:02:48.110000-->0:02:53.830000
 I've lived in Newcastle. I've lived, you know, quite different places. So my accent's probably

15
0:02:53.830000-->0:03:00.090000
 changed. But like my grandfather, his accent was really broad and nobody could understand.

16
0:03:04.790000-->0:03:21.320000
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And just to stay at home at the minute, my youngest son's just gone to secondary

17
0:03:21.320000-->0:03:27.300000
 school. So I am looking for work, but it's really hard because of where I live. It's in the middle

18
0:03:27.300000-->0:03:43.660000
 of nowhere and I don't drive. So it's going to have to be something really local. Yeah. I've

19
0:03:43.660000-->0:03:47.980000
 never worked because I had my first son at 17. So I've always been just a mum.

20
0:03:52.300000-->0:04:06.210000
 Just been a mum and that's it. Yeah. Yeah. I have an adult.
