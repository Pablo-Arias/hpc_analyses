0:00:00.900000-->0:00:18
 Hello, hello. I can't hear you. Yeah, I can hear you. I can try to crank you up a bit.

1
0:00:18-->0:00:25.750000
 Oh, you are cranked up. Okay, that's it then. Okay, thank you. So my name is Annette and

2
0:00:25.750000-->0:00:38.410000
 I'm from Exeter. What about you? Oh, wow. Yeah, I know it's like straight line all across

3
0:00:38.410000-->0:00:45.250000
 the country. I actually applied to study at the University of Aberdeen, but they didn't take me.

4
0:00:46.390000-->0:00:47.670000
 Their loss.

5
0:00:59-->0:01:06.350000
 Yeah, maybe, maybe. Who knows what you do? Yeah, I know. I researched. I looked into it. I was

6
0:01:06.350000-->0:01:10.230000
 like, oh, that's really nice. It's kind of small and the uni looked really good. The course

7
0:01:10.230000-->0:01:16.530000
 looked really good. Aberdeen was my preferred option. That's the uni I wanted to go to.

8
0:01:16.530000-->0:01:20.950000
 So when someone says Aberdeen, I'll be like, oh, I wanted to go there.

9
0:01:22.130000-->0:01:29.750000
 But hey, one day I'll get there. I went to Exeter. Yeah, so I went to Exeter. So yeah,

10
0:01:29.750000-->0:01:35.070000
 I moved here for uni and then just stayed here. I think it's quite common, isn't it, for people to

11
0:01:35.070000-->0:01:42.370000
 just get stuck in one place as a result of their uni adventures. What about you?

12
0:01:42.370000-->0:01:57.310000
 Where did you study? What did you study? Oh, wow. Amazing. Oh, wow.

13
0:01:58.650000-->0:02:03.510000
 Yeah, I was like, and they just were like, are you treating seals in the hospital?

14
0:02:09.450000-->0:02:09.470000
 Yeah.

15
0:02:24.820000-->0:02:31.720000
 I mean, NHS is good, isn't it? Because you get the NHS pension, right? Yeah, that's good.

16
0:02:34.150000-->0:02:37.480000
 Yeah, well, twists and roundabouts, isn't it?

17
0:02:37.860000-->0:02:46.880000
 So I work for Sustainability Consultancy, based in London. So I work from home and I'm spending

18
0:02:46.880000-->0:02:51.400000
 my lunch breaks like this, as you can see, talking to strangers on the internet.

19
0:02:55.420000-->0:03:00.530000
 Yeah, just like talk to people. Okay.

20
0:03:01.290000-->0:03:05.270000
 Random. I thought it's going to be like more instructions there, but no.

21
0:03:08.500000-->0:03:28.310000
 Yeah, that's really good. Okay. The same. The same. To be fair, because I've been doing things

22
0:03:28.310000-->0:03:35.610000
 like that during uni, since uni, and I feel like it's mostly like women that like participate in

23
0:03:35.610000-->0:03:42.850000
 things like that, whether that just we are led to be more chattier, or we're led to be more kind of

24
0:03:42.850000-->0:03:48.230000
 volunteering spirited. I don't know. But there is definitely something going on there.

25
0:03:52.400000-->0:03:59.740000
 Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Well, gender norms.

26
0:04:00.160000-->0:04:05.260000
 Hopefully, someone will define gender norms. I will speak to a man as well for diversity.
