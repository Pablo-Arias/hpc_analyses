 Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Lea.

1
0:00:18.650000-->0:00:25.720000
 Sorry, this is such a surreal study to take part in. Have you ever done anything like

2
0:00:25.720000-->0:00:26.240000
 this before?

3
0:00:26.240000-->0:00:26.900000
 No.

4
0:00:27.750000-->0:00:28.290000
 Yeah.

5
0:00:30.720000-->0:00:30.760000
 I know.

6
0:00:33.100000-->0:00:48.190000
 I know, I know. Yeah, I've been on the platform probably for about, I'm so sorry, I know you

7
0:00:48.190000-->0:00:53.890000
 asked the question, but I was just like, oh, this is so strange. Yeah, I've been on Prolific

8
0:00:53.890000-->0:01:00.110000
 for about three years now, so yeah, a fairly long time. But no, I've never done anything

9
0:01:00.110000-->0:01:05.230000
 like this before. Like you say, I've done video calls where you've had a topic or you've

10
0:01:05.230000-->0:01:09.810000
 had a task to complete and you have to interact with the person. They've got some information,

11
0:01:09.810000-->0:01:22.980000
 you've got some information, but yeah, nothing like this, nothing like this. But yeah, yeah,

12
0:01:22.980000-->0:01:40.980000
 I validate. Exactly. Yeah. No, I know, I didn't. I was thinking maybe it's to do with

13
0:01:40.980000-->0:01:45.440000
 obviously Verizon video calling and remote working and building relationships, but I

14
0:01:45.440000-->0:01:47.560000
 don't know. I don't know. But no.

15
0:01:47.560000-->0:01:52.720000
 So to answer your question, at the weekend, it looks nice weather, so probably going out

16
0:01:52.720000-->0:02:12.920000
 for a walk. What about you? Lovely. I know. Do you work full time? Yeah. Yeah, full time

17
0:02:12.920000-->0:02:18.560000
 as well. I mean, it's nice that I can dip in and out and do things like this. But yeah.

18
0:02:22.290000-->0:02:30.730000
 Oh, I know. And then I think it's quite nice because everyone kind of goes, it's an unwritten

19
0:02:30.730000-->0:02:34.410000
 rule, isn't there, about Friday afternoons where you're like, just don't bother me. I

20
0:02:34.410000-->0:02:38.510000
 just need to get stuff done before we all sign off for the week. Please leave me alone,

21
0:02:38.590000-->0:02:49.190000
 which is actually quite nice. Yeah. So what about you? Oh, lovely. So I'm the other side

22
0:02:49.190000-->0:02:58.830000
 in Suffolk. Yeah. So I used to live in Gloucestershire and then we moved over to East Anglia in the

23
0:02:58.830000-->0:03:03.810000
 pandemic, which is quite nice. But yeah, it's really nice here. I would say lovely weather,

24
0:03:03.810000-->0:03:10.710000
 even if it's a bit cold at the minute. But yeah, yeah, this is, yeah. Is this your fourth

25
0:03:10.710000-->0:03:19.440000
 conversation that you've been having or? I think so. I think it's my last one as well,

26
0:03:19.440000-->0:03:33.930000
 which is, yeah, as I said, this has been one. Oh, maybe. So I've spoken to a lady originally

27
0:03:33.930000-->0:03:56.900000
 from Canada. No. Okay. Maybe. Yeah. No. Oh, that's really interesting. I've only had females,

28
0:03:56.900000-->0:04:05.110000
 so no guys. So that's really interesting. Oh, I know. That's flown by. And you, enjoy,

29
0:04:05.110000-->0:04:08.750000
 and I hope you get your admin all caught up with. Lovely.
