0:00:13-->0:00:20.790000
 How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Where are you from?

1
0:00:24.400000-->0:00:26.600000
 So you are right now in Turkey?

2
0:00:28.200000-->0:00:29.530000
 No, I'm in the UK.

3
0:00:31.600000-->0:00:38.760000
 Alright. So I'm from Macedonia originally, but I live in the UK now.

4
0:00:38.760000-->0:00:45.380000
 I came here to study and I'm married and I'm in the last seven years in the UK.

5
0:00:45.380000-->0:00:52.790000
 Yes, I'm married into the British person, yes.

6
0:00:57.550000-->0:01:03.020000
 Okay. So why did you came to the UK from Turkey?

7
0:01:03.100000-->0:01:21.460000
 Because I went to the UK scholarship.

8
0:01:21.460000-->0:01:31.390000
 Yeah, it's very similar.

9
0:01:31.550000-->0:01:33.450000
 Yeah, very similar experience.

10
0:01:33.550000-->0:01:39.750000
 So I got scholarship to study in the UK.

11
0:01:39.750000-->0:01:45.450000
 I did my master's degree in business psychology, but that was 2017.

12
0:01:53-->0:01:53.020000
 Yes.

13
0:01:53.020000-->0:01:54.620000
 Exactly, yeah.

14
0:01:59.950000-->0:02:05.370000
 It's in Essex, about 30-40 minutes with train from London.

15
0:02:06.980000-->0:02:10.600000
 I like it very much, yeah.

16
0:02:10.600000-->0:02:16.940000
 It's more intimate, it's like around 100,000 people, but it's more nice.

17
0:02:16.940000-->0:02:21.100000
 It's like a more greeny, smaller street, so I like it.

18
0:02:21.100000-->0:02:24.260000
 We have a high street, so I do like it very much.

19
0:02:28.050000-->0:02:34.690000
 It's very green and small, but it's very close to the town.

20
0:02:37.060000-->0:02:38.500000
 Yes, yes.

21
0:02:40.600000-->0:02:41.900000
 So it's good.

22
0:02:52.510000-->0:02:54.030000
 Exactly, yeah.

23
0:02:54.030000-->0:03:04.750000
 It's very like weather-friendly, so it's great at the moment, but it's not as warm as before.

24
0:03:06.150000-->0:03:10.490000
 Yeah, the weather is the big downside here for me.

25
0:03:10.490000-->0:03:14.370000
 I love it, but the weather is really one big minus.

26
0:03:14.870000-->0:03:15.990000
 And what do you study?

27
0:03:19.530000-->0:03:19.950000
 English.

28
0:03:20.630000-->0:03:21.910000
 So you're teaching English.

29
0:03:23.150000-->0:03:24.610000
 That's good, okay.

30
0:03:24.610000-->0:03:27.910000
 So it's like a language university, yes?

31
0:03:27.910000-->0:03:30.330000
 All right, that's good.

32
0:03:31.150000-->0:03:36.650000
 I actually worry a lot.

33
0:03:37.330000-->0:03:37.870000
 Uh-huh.

34
0:03:38.050000-->0:03:43.940000
 I'm trying to do something, right?

35
0:03:44.320000-->0:03:44.760000
 Yeah.

36
0:03:44.760000-->0:03:52.750000
 I'm going to do it, and I think it's great.

37
0:03:55.900000-->0:03:57.650000
 But I'm trying to do it.

38
0:03:57.650000-->0:04:02.520000
 I'm trying to do it.

39
0:04:02.520000-->0:04:03.920000
 I have to find a job.

40
0:04:06.670000-->0:04:08.230000
 Exactly, yeah.

41
0:04:08.590000-->0:04:08.970000
 Yeah.
