 Hi. Are you okay? I'm good, thank you. My first person didn't work, so I don't know.

1
0:00:18.700000-->0:00:29.790000
 I've just had a technical issue or something, I don't think. Oh, right. Okay, then. Well,

2
0:00:29.790000-->0:00:37.810000
 I live in the Midlands. I don't know whereabouts you are. How long have you done Prolific for?

3
0:00:37.850000-->0:00:46.200000
 Yeah, I've just had a knee replacement about, what are we now, five weeks ago, so I'm just,

4
0:00:46.200000-->0:00:51.420000
 well, I've been waiting to get this knee done, which has taken for ages, as you can imagine

5
0:00:51.420000-->0:00:56.340000
 with the NHS at the moment. I've just been doing Prolific because I can do it at home

6
0:00:56.340000-->0:01:12.100000
 and you don't do it a lot, do you? But it's a bit. Yeah, I mean, I'm hoping to go back

7
0:01:12.100000-->0:01:19.660000
 to work. I've been stuck at home, what, two years now, so it's as much as I love my house,

8
0:01:19.660000-->0:01:28.240000
 I'm like, no. I'm like, I want to talk to other people now, so. Cabin fever, yes. All right,

9
0:01:28.240000-->0:01:32.740000
 when my son's at home from uni at Christmas or something, but one of my other kids lives

10
0:01:33.160000-->0:01:44.760000
 and the other ones, they're just really busy, so not a lot going on, really. Oh God,

11
0:01:44.760000-->0:01:50.380000
 yeah, make the most of it. Make the most of it. Honestly, when they leave, it's horrendous. I hate

12
0:01:50.380000-->0:02:05.540000
 it. Yeah. I know, it's really hard now. My son's up in Edge Hill. He's doing teaching up there.

13
0:02:05.540000-->0:02:11.680000
 That's the youngest one. I've got three kids, so we live about an hour and a half away from there,

14
0:02:11.680000-->0:02:20.140000
 so it's not too bad. Yes, it is, yeah. Yeah, Ormskirk. But they don't give them much student

15
0:02:20.140000-->0:02:31.960000
 loan anymore, so get saving. Yeah, that's my only advice. And it's the accommodation.

16
0:02:32.620000-->0:02:39.680000
 Accommodation's massive. If he was just left to his own devices, he'd have 400 pounds for this

17
0:02:39.680000-->0:02:48.260000
 whole term for everything. He has gone in a better accommodation. He could have gone in

18
0:02:48.260000-->0:02:54.280000
 cheaper accommodation, but he's autistic, Matt, so we don't like to put him under any pressure

19
0:02:54.280000-->0:03:00.630000
 anywhere. Yeah, so they've been very good up there. They've let him stay on campus all the

20
0:03:00.630000-->0:03:09.840000
 three years he's been there so that he doesn't have to do the change, so yeah. Yeah, yeah,

21
0:03:09.840000-->0:03:14.200000
 every Wednesday, he loves it. Yeah, he's hoping to go to Japan. He's never been out the country,

22
0:03:14.200000-->0:03:20.080000
 so I don't know how that's going to happen, but he's hoping to do this TEFL thing and go and

23
0:03:20.080000-->0:03:29.420000
 teach in Japan later on in the year, so. No, I don't think so. I mean, maybe the TEFL is just

24
0:03:29.660000-->0:03:35.460000
 a qualification to speak, sorry, to teach in Japan. You don't have to speak Japanese,

25
0:03:35.460000-->0:03:42.740000
 but you have to like be able to thingy, so he loves that anime culture and all that kind of

26
0:03:42.740000-->0:03:55.950000
 crap, so I'm not into it at all. It says, yeah, we can't, for someone who is so disorganized,

27
0:03:55.950000-->0:04:01.390000
 it's over in 15 seconds, so nice to meet you, we can't believe how organized he's been with

28
0:04:01.390000-->0:04:05.630000
 his uni course because he can like come back and the place is like a tip within,

29
0:04:05.630000-->0:04:09.710000
 his bedroom's a tip within like two days, but when he goes to uni, everything's all.
