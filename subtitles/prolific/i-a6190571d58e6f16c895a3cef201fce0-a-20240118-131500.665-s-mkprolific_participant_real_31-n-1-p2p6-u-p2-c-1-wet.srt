 Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi, thanks. Are you North Wales? Whereabouts are you? All right. Yeah, what's

1
0:00:28.830000-->0:00:34.710000
 I used to live in Hertfordshire and also Milton Keynes, so I'm familiar with the area. What's

2
0:00:34.710000-->0:00:47.140000
 the weather? What's the weather like at the moment? Yeah, I live by the sea, but unusually

3
0:00:47.140000-->0:00:52.520000
 we've still got snow right on the seafront, which is really unusual, but it's probably

4
0:00:52.520000-->0:00:57
 colder inland, I would have thought. So, but yeah, there's loads of snow on the mountains

5
0:00:57-->0:01:09.130000
 here. Oh, but it's gorgeous in the summer. It's really nice. So looking over Anglesey

6
0:01:09.130000-->0:01:14.850000
 and the views of the mountains, that's really nice. So whereabouts in Bedfordshire are you?

7
0:01:14.850000-->0:01:25.040000
 Whereabouts in Bedfordshire? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Is it Bobby Brew, the books growing up? Is

8
0:01:25.040000-->0:01:30.540000
 it Bobby Brewster? Is it Bobby Brewster books from Biggleswade? It is. Years ago, growing

9
0:01:30.540000-->0:01:35.300000
 up, I remember reading. I only know about the area, as I say, because I, you know, I

10
0:01:35.300000-->0:01:41.560000
 lived sort of Milton Keynes and Hertfordshire and so on. So vaguely familiar with the area.

11
0:01:42.040000-->0:02:08.430000
 Oh, I'm just trying to think. A couple of years now. What about yourself? Oh, OK. And

12
0:02:08.430000-->0:02:15.280000
 apparently, I don't know if you use Reddit at all as a social media. Yeah. Yeah. Because

13
0:02:15.280000-->0:02:23.380000
 that's true. Yeah. And that's where is apparently, isn't it, where people, if you do a lot of

14
0:02:23.380000-->0:02:30.560000
 studies or time or whatever, it slows down. And I've noticed certainly, even in the last

15
0:02:30.560000-->0:02:36.260000
 year, it's slowed down loads. There's a lot more people that I guess who joined as well.

16
0:02:36.280000-->0:02:55.420000
 But it's still good, isn't it? Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. So it's reassuring. There's a

17
0:02:55.420000-->0:03:01.200000
 lot of quite negative people on it, though, as well. Do you find? It's quite funny. It makes

18
0:03:01.200000-->0:03:31.550000
 me laugh sometimes. Yeah. Oh, I know. They get loads. So we just leap through it. There's one,

19
0:03:31.550000-->0:03:37.870000
 and then we don't get into it anyway, do we? But it's good. I like the feeling of contributing

20
0:03:37.870000-->0:03:42.030000
 to research as well, as well as obviously it's helpful for us. It's good, isn't it?

21
0:03:48.500000-->0:03:55.020000
 I know. Yeah, I was just in front of the computer doing. Oh, we've got 15. Oh,

22
0:03:55.020000-->0:04:04.700000
 well, it's lovely to meet you anyway. Yeah. Yeah. What's your name? Sorry. My name is Jill

23
0:04:06.950000-->0:04:08.930000
 Rayner. Oh, it's lovely to meet you.
