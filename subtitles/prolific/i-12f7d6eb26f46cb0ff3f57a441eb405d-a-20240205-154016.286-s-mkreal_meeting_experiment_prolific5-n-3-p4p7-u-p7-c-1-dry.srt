 Hi, how are you? Oh really? Oh no, oh no. Hopefully this will run away a bit better.

1
0:00:46.500000-->0:00:57.920000
 London, yeah. Oh nice, I like North Wales. Yeah I went to Snowdonia for the first time

2
0:00:57.920000-->0:01:02.800000
 maybe three years ago, two years ago. I'd never been and I thought it was lovely, really

3
0:01:02.800000-->0:01:39.150000
 liked it. Whereabouts are you? Oh yeah, yeah. Oh nice, that's cool. Okay. Whereabouts in

4
0:01:39.150000-->0:01:47.760000
 South Africa were you? Okay, yeah. I went to South Africa last year, about this time

5
0:01:47.760000-->0:01:53.160000
 last year actually, but I flew back from Johannesburg but I didn't really get to see it because

6
0:01:53.160000-->0:01:58.340000
 I'd driven from the south so I didn't really get a chance to stay there. But South Africa

7
0:01:58.340000-->0:02:10.040000
 was really interesting. Early January for about three weeks? Yeah, it was really hot

8
0:02:10.040000-->0:02:53.540000
 in certain parts, yeah. Cape Town area was fine, but yeah. Okay, okay, yeah. Yeah, Cape

9
0:02:53.540000-->0:02:59.800000
 Town wasn't that warm. It was really nice, but it was a lot cooler. And then it'd be

10
0:02:59.800000-->0:03:05.220000
 like kind of misty, I suppose, like very cloudy all the time. And then yeah, like the like

11
0:03:05.220000-->0:03:12.470000
 further north you got, it was absolutely baking. It was really, really warm. I liked it. Sorry?

12
0:03:12.470000-->0:03:21.400000
 Yes, yeah I did. It was really hot. I thought it would be a lot easier than it was. It was

13
0:03:21.400000-->0:03:36.070000
 really tough. But yeah, that was good. Yeah, no, you get an amazing view at the top. Yeah.

14
0:03:36.070000-->0:04:09.090000
 All right. Oh no. No, me neither. Very quickly. Yeah, nice to talk to you too. Hopefully you get

15
0:04:09.090000-->0:04:09.750000
 to South Africa.
