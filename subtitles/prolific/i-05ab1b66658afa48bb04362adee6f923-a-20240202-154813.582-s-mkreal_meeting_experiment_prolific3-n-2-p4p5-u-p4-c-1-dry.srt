 Bongo, calm down.

1
0:00:05.650000-->0:00:12.950000
 Hi there.

2
0:00:13.130000-->0:00:17.040000
 Hi. How are you?

3
0:00:19.810000-->0:00:22.530000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you hear me?

4
0:00:27.450000-->0:00:30.250000
 Yeah, yeah. I can only see you as well, yeah.

5
0:00:33.250000-->0:00:35.740000
 I can see you, but I cannot see myself either.

6
0:00:37.880000-->0:00:46.860000
 How are you? You ready for the weekend?

7
0:00:55.500000-->0:00:58.830000
 Okay. You getting better?

8
0:01:10.520000-->0:01:15.230000
 Oh, no. Yeah, the cold doesn't help.

9
0:01:15.230000-->0:01:16.510000
 And what happened to your leg?

10
0:01:19.360000-->0:01:30.770000
 Oh. Oh. Oh, God, that sounds terrible.

11
0:01:30.770000-->0:01:34.410000
 Well, hopefully a little bit more of resting

12
0:01:34.410000-->0:01:36.570000
 can help you get there.

13
0:01:51.600000-->0:01:52.360000
 Yeah.

14
0:01:55.500000-->0:02:01.810000
 Are you keeping your leg elevated and you're putting ice?

15
0:02:04.650000-->0:02:05.830000
 Oh, well, I hope.
