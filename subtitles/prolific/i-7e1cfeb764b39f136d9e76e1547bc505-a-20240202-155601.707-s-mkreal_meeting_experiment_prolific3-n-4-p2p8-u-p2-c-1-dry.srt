0:00:05.200000-->0:00:17.450000
 Hi. Hiya. Hiya, I can hear you. Can you hear me okay?

1
0:00:17.450000-->0:00:26.570000
 Oh, that's so good.

2
0:00:28.450000-->0:00:36.830000
 Ah, yes I am actually. That was a lucky guess.

3
0:00:36.830000-->0:00:39.290000
 Ah, classics. How did you know?

4
0:00:41.840000-->0:00:44.340000
 Age. It was a good guess.

5
0:00:45.450000-->0:00:47.470000
 Um, yeah, I'm finishing up my masters right now.

6
0:00:47.470000-->0:00:50.570000
 Oh, I have no idea.

7
0:00:50.570000-->0:00:56.910000
 I did the masters kind of hoping it would give me a better idea of what I'm going to do in the future,

8
0:00:56.910000-->0:01:01.870000
 but I'm coming to the end of it with no better answers to give to any of my family or anything.

9
0:01:01.870000-->0:01:03.050000
 So that's fun.

10
0:01:03.050000-->0:01:13.160000
 It is, but one, it terrifies me, and two, yesterday during my seminar,

11
0:01:13.160000-->0:01:15.040000
 my professor was warning all of us.

12
0:01:15.040000-->0:01:18.980000
 She was saying, do not do a PhD, no matter what you do, do not do it.

13
0:01:18.980000-->0:01:21.860000
 I was shocked coming from a professor to be saying that.

14
0:01:21.860000-->0:01:25.880000
 She was saying that it's just not worth working in academia anymore,

15
0:01:25.880000-->0:01:28.820000
 like the pay is awful, you're constantly stressed out.

16
0:01:28.820000-->0:01:32.920000
 She was like, go get a job and come back much, much later.

17
0:01:32.920000-->0:01:36.840000
 I was like, I respect being honest actually, like I really respect her.

18
0:01:36.840000-->0:01:40.040000
 She was like, I refuse to lie to any of my students anymore about it,

19
0:01:40.040000-->0:01:42.060000
 and I was really surprised by that.

20
0:01:47.420000-->0:01:57.150000
 Yes, honestly.

21
0:02:05.470000-->0:02:06.630000
 Yeah, absolutely.

22
0:02:06.630000-->0:02:10.750000
 She was saying that both her and her husband have PhDs and they both are in academia,

23
0:02:10.750000-->0:02:15.190000
 and their daughter has seen them just stressed 24-7,

24
0:02:15.190000-->0:02:17.230000
 and she apparently just said, nope, I'm not doing it,

25
0:02:17.230000-->0:02:20.870000
 not touching further education, passing undergrad, which, fair, yeah.

26
0:02:20.870000-->0:02:24.840000
 I completely understand that, yeah.

27
0:02:25.100000-->0:02:27.620000
 What do you do, if you don't mind me asking?

28
0:02:28.480000-->0:02:29.460000
 Oh, okay, nice.

29
0:02:30.700000-->0:02:31.520000
 Oh, that's nice.

30
0:02:32-->0:02:33.100000
 How have you been finding it?

31
0:02:43.100000-->0:02:46.620000
 Oh, my gosh.

32
0:02:54.350000-->0:02:55.740000
 That's so exciting.

33
0:02:58.050000-->0:02:59.540000
 Oh, my gosh.

34
0:02:59.600000-->0:03:03.990000
 That's amazing.

35
0:03:08.950000-->0:03:10.250000
 Oh, that's so exciting.

36
0:03:10.250000-->0:03:13.530000
 Do you have anywhere else you really want to go now that you have the time?

37
0:03:25.900000-->0:03:27.160000
 That would be amazing.

38
0:03:29.400000-->0:03:30.680000
 What's your favourite place?

39
0:03:31.300000-->0:03:32
 Oh, really?

40
0:03:32.300000-->0:03:32.940000
 Where did you go?

41
0:03:40.370000-->0:03:42.330000
 Wow, you're so well-travelled.

42
0:03:45.700000-->0:03:47.180000
 That sounds honestly amazing.

43
0:03:47.180000-->0:03:48.180000
 I haven't really travelled.

44
0:03:48.700000-->0:03:49.960000
 I haven't really travelled much.

45
0:03:49.960000-->0:03:54.680000
 I kind of went straight from high school to uni,

46
0:03:54.700000-->0:03:59.660000
 and then I had COVID in the middle, so that kind of put, yeah.

47
0:03:59.700000-->0:04:02.500000
 Yeah, they put a halt to any of my plans,

48
0:04:02.500000-->0:04:05.640000
 but hopefully maybe after the Master's, give myself a little break.
