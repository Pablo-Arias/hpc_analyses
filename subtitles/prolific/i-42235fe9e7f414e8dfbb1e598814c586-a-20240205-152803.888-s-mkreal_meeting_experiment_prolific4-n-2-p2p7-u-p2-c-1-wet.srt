 Hello.

1
0:00:15.020000-->0:00:15.640000
 Hello, hi.

2
0:00:15.640000-->0:00:27.910000
 You were lucky because I couldn't see and I couldn't hear nothing.

3
0:00:32.600000-->0:00:32.780000
 Wow.

4
0:00:33.360000-->0:00:33.620000
 Okay.

5
0:00:33.620000-->0:00:36
 Nice to meet you.

6
0:00:39.200000-->0:00:42.880000
 Are you doing a lot of tests like this?

7
0:00:42.880000-->0:00:45.420000
 Do you participate a lot or study?

8
0:00:45.420000-->0:00:51.100000
 Yeah, okay.

9
0:01:03.100000-->0:01:06.080000
 I do a lot.

10
0:01:06.080000-->0:01:13.760000
 Actually, I joined the prolific I think about more than a year ago and mostly I'm interested

11
0:01:13.760000-->0:01:16.260000
 in AI and programming tests they gave me.

12
0:01:16.400000-->0:01:24.580000
 It's very interesting because you can see how the AI system is trained by your question

13
0:01:24.580000-->0:01:25
 actually.

14
0:01:25.760000-->0:01:27
 Yeah, I like it.

15
0:01:27.400000-->0:01:28.900000
 Yeah, it's very fun.

16
0:01:37.100000-->0:01:38.800000
 I do love them.

17
0:01:39.100000-->0:01:45.440000
 I don't know why because I'm very busy but in my spare time I enjoy doing that.

18
0:01:45.440000-->0:01:54.230000
 I think it's just kind of because most of the tests are just given by a very good university

19
0:01:54.230000-->0:02:01.930000
 so I think the qualities are high and I think I'm learning from them to be honest.

20
0:02:02.150000-->0:02:09.490000
 I'm not a person who enjoys playing games so this is kind of my game to be honest.

21
0:02:42.370000-->0:02:42.850000
 Exactly.

22
0:02:42.850000-->0:02:49.290000
 I think I'm very busy because I'm doing also PhD so I don't have a lot of time but anytime

23
0:02:49.290000-->0:02:56.150000
 running code in the middle of that I participate in this kind of test and I guess it's kind

24
0:02:56.650000-->0:03:02.470000
 of helping me coping mechanism when I have a stress.

25
0:03:02.470000-->0:03:05.190000
 I just forget about everything and just come to this.

26
0:03:05.190000-->0:03:07.910000
 It's fun.

27
0:03:07.910000-->0:03:09.910000
 For me it's just a matter of fun.

28
0:03:10.250000-->0:03:10.910000
 A little money.

29
0:03:10.910000-->0:03:13.630000
 Money is not a lot when I'm teaching.

30
0:03:13.630000-->0:03:17.470000
 I earn more money than this but actually that's fun.

31
0:03:17.470000-->0:03:18.850000
 It's just fun.

32
0:03:23.930000-->0:03:24.170000
 Yeah.

33
0:03:24.170000-->0:03:31.580000
 Yeah, exactly.

34
0:03:31.580000-->0:03:37.700000
 I just consider this as extra bonus or get some money but the main thing is just I'm

35
0:03:37.700000-->0:03:39.560000
 not very good playing games.

36
0:03:39.560000-->0:03:42.680000
 For example, my husband really likes playing games every time.

37
0:03:42.680000-->0:03:48.680000
 It's just a way to cope with the stress but I don't have a kind of coping mechanism to

38
0:03:48.680000-->0:03:50.680000
 stress and a lot of things I'm doing.

39
0:03:50.680000-->0:03:59.560000
 So every time this happens, every time, especially when I'm doing AI and it was very interesting.

40
0:03:59.560000-->0:04:07.680000
 I took a lot of course in a study about AI, how to train AI and it was very interesting.
