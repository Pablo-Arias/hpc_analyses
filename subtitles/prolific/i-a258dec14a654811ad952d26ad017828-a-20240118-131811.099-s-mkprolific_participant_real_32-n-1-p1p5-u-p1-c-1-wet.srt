0:00:12.950000-->0:00:28.240000
 Hello? Yeah I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yeah. No I think we just asked as if we've

1
0:00:28.240000-->0:00:35.160000
 met each other in like a bar or something. So I suppose first question, what's your name?

2
0:00:40.640000-->0:00:54.420000
 I'm Claire and I live in Derbyshire. Yeah we're not, we're not too far from there.

3
0:00:57.830000-->0:01:05.910000
 It goes Derby, Derby, Chesterfield, Sheffield I think. Because Sheffield's like just under,

4
0:01:05.910000-->0:01:15.510000
 Chesterfield is just under Sheffield so it's not too far. Yeah, I live in the middle of nowhere

5
0:01:15.510000-->0:01:19.630000
 so there's countryside everywhere which is really good because we've got a dog so

6
0:01:22.950000-->0:01:35
 she's a boxer across Dogue de Bordeaux. Yeah we, yeah we have, we have cats too.

7
0:01:35.280000-->0:01:37.200000
 We have nine cats.

8
0:01:43.660000-->0:01:45.660000
 Nope, not that show off.

9
0:01:55.670000-->0:02:00.250000
 Unless it's jumped down, it might have jumped down like, no you can't see me.

10
0:02:06.090000-->0:02:13.110000
 We took some on as rescues and then we had a male cat that we didn't know was male and got

11
0:02:13.110000-->0:02:32.190000
 one of ours pregnant so. Yeah the dog gets on really well with them as well, I think she thinks

12
0:02:32.190000-->0:02:43.990000
 she's one of them. But we lost him, yeah. We lost our oldest one just after Christmas, she was like

13
0:02:43.990000-->0:02:52.660000
 15 and she just, she had a stroke and there was nothing they could do. They said it's, she's just

14
0:02:52.660000-->0:03:01.920000
 gonna go in and she went to sleep and that were it so. But I suppose you have to get kind of,

15
0:03:01.920000-->0:03:15.040000
 because most of our, quite a few of our cats are elderly now so you know it's, yeah.

16
0:03:16.680000-->0:03:21.180000
 A couple of the others, we've got an eight-year-old, a nine-year-old and a ten-year-old

17
0:03:21.180000-->0:03:24.220000
 so they're getting, they are in their retirement now.

18
0:03:33.220000-->0:03:38.260000
 No, the one, the one that we lost just after Christmas, she was still acting like a kitten.

19
0:03:38.440000-->0:03:43.180000
 All of a sudden she was just, one minute she was running around, the next minute she was just laying

20
0:03:43.180000-->0:03:50.740000
 on the step, on the stairs, couldn't move. She'd lost all movement, rang the vets, we got her ready

21
0:03:50.740000-->0:04:06.550000
 to go to the vets and she passed away within half an hour. So yeah, yeah. 15 seconds, yeah.
