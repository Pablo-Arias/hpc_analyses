 Hello. How are you?

1
0:00:21.870000-->0:00:26.280000
 Sorry? Nice to see you.

2
0:00:26.280000-->0:00:28.060000
 What's your name?

3
0:00:30.050000-->0:00:32.510000
 My name is Yagoda.

4
0:00:32.510000-->0:00:34.710000
 You are in the UK, yes?

5
0:00:37.640000-->0:00:41.960000
 Well, I think all the rest of the participants were in the UK,

6
0:00:41.960000-->0:00:44.700000
 so I was thinking, yeah, it's just UK participants.

7
0:00:44.700000-->0:00:45.580000
 Yeah.

8
0:00:47.450000-->0:00:49.450000
 No, I wouldn't be able to know.

9
0:00:53.820000-->0:00:56.660000
 No, no, no. I'm from Macedonia.

10
0:01:04.700000-->0:01:09.420000
 Oh, okay.

11
0:01:11.290000-->0:01:13.270000
 And you are from Italy, or?

12
0:01:22.540000-->0:01:25.060000
 Okay, okay, because you asked me if I'm from Italy.

13
0:01:25.060000-->0:01:26.860000
 Maybe you recognize something.

14
0:01:42.500000-->0:01:45.900000
 Like a European, yeah, European accent.

15
0:01:46.500000-->0:01:46.820000
 Okay.

16
0:01:52.800000-->0:01:58.200000
 That's really nice. I've been about almost three years now on Freelifex.

17
0:02:19.050000-->0:02:19.070000
 Yeah.

18
0:02:36.680000-->0:02:36.700000
 Yeah.

19
0:02:36.700000-->0:02:37.700000
 Yes, I do like it.

20
0:02:37.700000-->0:02:45.360000
 Yeah, but what I did in the last period is, because there were really small payments like 0.15, 0.25,

21
0:02:45.700000-->0:02:49.100000
 and you're even risking to be rejected for a study.

22
0:02:50.700000-->0:02:53.560000
 And then you need to write with researchers.

23
0:02:53.700000-->0:03:00.700000
 So I just decided to do only the ones that are paying more than Â£1.50,

24
0:03:00.700000-->0:03:03.320000
 and I think that works much better.

25
0:03:03.320000-->0:03:05.820000
 Yeah, it works much better with less work.

26
0:03:05.820000-->0:03:12.820000
 i'm actually getting exactly the same amount of money because i'm just saying clicking not

27
0:03:12.820000-->0:03:19.560000
 interested on the ones that are not paying well so i think algorithm it wants to catch up to

28
0:03:19.560000-->0:03:29.380000
 because there is algorithm isn't it you know behind so i decided to do that way because

29
0:03:29.380000-->0:03:34.960000
 really it was frustrating sometimes there will be a problem just for 0.15

30
0:03:34.960000-->0:03:41.580000
 unless you will have problem it will not open or whatever i'm like i don't want to bother really

31
0:03:41.580000-->0:03:50.960000
 because i also do other platforms and the payment on prolific it's actually not as good as on other

32
0:03:50.960000-->0:04:06.800000
 platforms so i so it is uh like user testing you know it's different than prolific it's but it's

33
0:04:06.800000-->0:04:09.800000
 not not like typing like
