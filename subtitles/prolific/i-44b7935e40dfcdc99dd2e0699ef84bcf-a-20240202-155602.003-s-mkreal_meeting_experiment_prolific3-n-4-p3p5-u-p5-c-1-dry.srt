 No, I'm good, but all I can hear is distortion in the background. I'm sorry, I can't hear

1
0:00:30.950000-->0:00:36.150000
 you. Yeah, but there's a lot of distortion in the background. It's kind of like, it's

2
0:00:36.150000-->0:00:49.540000
 making a weird noise, should I say. It might be the headphones. Yeah, but it's the same

3
0:00:49.540000-->0:01:05.510000
 distortion. That's really strange. I know. I think maybe the headphones, it has some

4
0:01:05.510000-->0:01:17.700000
 kind of issue. So there's just, literally, there's a constant scratching. I mean, I

5
0:01:17.700000-->0:01:23.360000
 can hear your voice, as in, yeah, but it's just the background noise is really loud.

6
0:01:27.890000-->0:01:49.940000
 Don't worry, we'll try our best. So how many people did you have before? Oh, okay, good,

7
0:01:49.940000-->0:01:57.920000
 good, good. I've had two people so far. None of us are sure what this experiment is about.

8
0:01:57.920000-->0:02:14.370000
 We're not sure. We're just like, what do they want people to do? Just sit and talk? Yeah,

9
0:02:15.190000-->0:02:21.430000
 that's what we were guessing. However, why not just tell us before? Just say, okay, this

10
0:02:21.430000-->0:02:26.230000
 is what it's about. We want to see how strangers interact. We didn't know anything. We're just

11
0:02:26.230000-->0:02:42.550000
 kind of coming in like, okay, what are we supposed to do? Huh? Hang on. Did I miss that

12
0:02:42.550000-->0:02:50.890000
 part? Did I miss that part? Maybe I did, because I was reading it, and then I said, okay, that

13
0:02:50.890000-->0:02:56.470000
 sounds good. They said, okay, you need to be on camera. I said, okay, that's fine. But

14
0:02:56.470000-->0:03:01.370000
 maybe I missed, because I skimmed red, because I'm trying to do about two things at one time.

15
0:03:01.370000-->0:03:25.940000
 That's about why I missed it. Are you doing anything nice for the weekend? Oh, you work

16
0:03:25.940000-->0:03:46.210000
 on Saturdays. Okay. I don't miss those days. I don't miss working on Saturday. I work from

17
0:03:46.210000-->0:03:58.920000
 home, so I work completely remote. Yeah, completely remote. You'll get to be, just look out for

18
0:03:58.920000-->0:04:04.860000
 the fully remote jobs, and hopefully you will find one, because I get that.
