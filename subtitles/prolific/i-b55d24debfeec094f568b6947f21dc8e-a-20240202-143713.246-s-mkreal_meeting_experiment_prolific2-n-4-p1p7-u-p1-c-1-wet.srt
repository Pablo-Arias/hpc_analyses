 Hiya. Hiya, I'm Raj, nice to meet you too. What are you doing at the weekend? Yeah, no

1
0:00:26.990000-->0:00:32.430000
 usually I've been in ones where they give you a topic, so not just where it's

2
0:00:32.430000-->0:00:37.710000
 just like just chit-chat, it's usually like talk about X, Y, Z, so I signed up with no

3
0:00:37.710000-->0:00:42.470000
 knowledge of what to expect and it seemed very straightforward, so yeah. Do

4
0:00:42.470000-->0:01:15.110000
 you use Prolific a lot? No, it's all right, don't worry, it's fine. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it makes me wonder what

5
0:01:15.110000-->0:01:20.590000
 the, like the, like what they're trying, what the hypothesis is that they're

6
0:01:20.590000-->0:01:26.230000
 trying to like, you know, confirm or disprove I guess, but I always try and

7
0:01:26.230000-->0:01:29.610000
 think about that when I'm doing a study, I'm like I wonder what they're trying to

8
0:01:29.610000-->0:01:32.170000
 actually get from this, because some of them are really straightforward and you

9
0:01:32.170000-->0:01:44.650000
 get it straight away, but some of them, not sure, and this is one of them. Yeah,

10
0:01:44.810000-->0:01:57.550000
 could be, could not be. Mine's pretty relaxed to be honest, not anything major, might go

11
0:01:57.550000-->0:02:01.950000
 see some family tomorrow and then just catch up on some life admin as well I

12
0:02:01.950000-->0:02:05.310000
 think, you know, when you're working in the week I think, you know, sometimes

13
0:02:05.310000-->0:02:17.020000
 things just fall by a little bit, so good to do that. I do, yeah, how about you? Oh yeah,

14
0:02:17.020000-->0:02:20.420000
 absolutely, yeah, it's a bit quieter on a Friday afternoon as well, which is why I'm

15
0:02:20.420000-->0:02:24.360000
 like, I actually have half an hour to spare, but if this is like a Tuesday,

16
0:02:24.360000-->0:02:45.550000
 probably not. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you do? No, it's all right, I'm in the West Midlands,

17
0:02:45.550000-->0:03:14.630000
 so near Birmingham. How about you? Oh nice, yeah, lovely, good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, good. This is, yes, so I think it's my

18
0:03:14.630000-->0:03:21.440000
 last one from what I read at the start. How about you? Yeah, I wonder if we were

19
0:03:21.440000-->0:03:26.350000
 speaking to the same people, but just in a different order. I wonder if it's, or if

20
0:03:26.350000-->0:03:30.190000
 they just mix and match it completely across, or if it's the same eight people

21
0:03:30.190000-->0:03:41.230000
 rotating? No, oh no, no one with a strong Canadian accent actually, so I've assumed

22
0:03:41.230000-->0:03:46.050000
 they're not, but I spoke to someone who was a midwife, and then I spoke to

23
0:03:46.050000-->0:03:50.970000
 someone who's currently studying and he's doing computer science, but it feels

24
0:03:50.970000-->0:04:00.240000
 like our people might be different, some of them. No. Well it was nice speaking to

25
0:04:00.240000-->0:04:08.780000
 you, just in the 15 seconds, but have a great weekend. Thank you, have a great weekend.
