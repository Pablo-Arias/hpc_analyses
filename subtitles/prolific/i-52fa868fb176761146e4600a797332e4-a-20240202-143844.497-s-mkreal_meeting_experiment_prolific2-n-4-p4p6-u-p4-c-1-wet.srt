 Hi! How are you? Good, thank you. Can you hear me well? Good, thank you. I answered to you.

1
0:00:28.540000-->0:00:53.690000
 And how are you? All good. And how about you? What's your name? Nice to meet you. I'm Yasmina.

2
0:00:56.570000-->0:01:15.200000
 Yes, where do you live, Ramadan? No, I'm not. But very often, my name is used in the Muslim country.

3
0:01:18.950000-->0:01:45.660000
 Thank you. Sorry? No. Why that question? That's actually just our kitchen. It's our kitchen.

4
0:01:46.200000-->0:01:57.250000
 But it looks like a laboratory. Where are you from? No, but yes, they can have that color as well.

5
0:01:57.250000-->0:02:10.010000
 I do understand the connection. No, no, you cannot. You're not hearing me. I'm asking where are you from?

6
0:02:12.760000-->0:02:26.610000
 Where are you from? Where do you live? Both of them. Yeah.

7
0:02:28.800000-->0:02:50.320000
 I would like to get to know you better, that's why. Nothing. Okay. Yes, of course, of course.

8
0:02:51.680000-->0:02:58.160000
 Yes, I do. I mean, I know where it is. I have been traveling actually to South Africa,

9
0:02:58.160000-->0:03:11.700000
 so I know it's far from Nigeria, but yes, I have been to Africa. To South Africa, to Cape Town?

10
0:03:17.060000-->0:03:24.380000
 I was doing a voluntary work there. I was volunteering for a daycare center,

11
0:03:24.660000-->0:03:37.840000
 so I spent a few months there. Oh, I really, really liked it. It's a beautiful

12
0:03:38.080000-->0:03:51.340000
 country. I don't know if you've ever been traveling there. Have you? Okay.

13
0:03:56.900000-->0:04:07.830000
 Okay. Yes, I see. It was really nice meeting you, and I wish you all the best.
