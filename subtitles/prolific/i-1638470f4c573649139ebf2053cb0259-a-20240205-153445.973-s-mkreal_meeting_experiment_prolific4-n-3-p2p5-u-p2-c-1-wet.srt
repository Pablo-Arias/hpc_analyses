 Hi. Thank you. Nice to see you in person. Nice to see you.

1
0:00:28.500000-->0:00:36.480000
 Sarah. Yeah, how do you know that?

2
0:00:36.500000-->0:00:47.770000
 Oh my God. Okay, yeah, I'm in London right now.

3
0:00:47.950000-->0:00:52.710000
 Okay. You're from Italy, yeah?

4
0:00:56.700000-->0:01:01.700000
 You're from Macedonia. One of my best friends is Macedonia.

5
0:01:01.700000-->0:01:07.280000
 Yeah, they are very lovely, lovely people. I met some of my friends from Macedonia.

6
0:01:07.400000-->0:01:09.860000
 Yeah, that's a lovely place.

7
0:01:13.550000-->0:01:18.710000
 I'm originally from Iran, but I've been out of Iran for a long period of time.

8
0:01:18.710000-->0:01:21.070000
 I'm a London PhD student.

9
0:01:27.660000-->0:01:31.840000
 The reason is a lot of my Italian friends also have the same accent,

10
0:01:31.840000-->0:01:36.580000
 but when you say you're from Macedonia, I remember one of my close friends

11
0:01:36.600000-->0:01:42.960000
 also has the same accent, so I could identify that kind of accent as well.

12
0:01:47.700000-->0:01:52.260000
 How do you find this prolific, the test?

13
0:01:56.900000-->0:02:02.100000
 Three years. You're a champion. I've been only for about one and a half years,

14
0:02:02.100000-->0:02:05.960000
 but I really enjoy it. I'm very busy, but in the middle of my work,

15
0:02:05.960000-->0:02:10.120000
 especially I'm a general programmer, so when I'm doing programming,

16
0:02:10.120000-->0:02:15.540000
 when I'm running in the middle of a test, I take a study and then go back.

17
0:02:15.900000-->0:02:24.080000
 It's very interesting. I think particularly the psychology, memory test,

18
0:02:24.080000-->0:02:29.580000
 AI test, teaching skills, programming skills, it was nice.

19
0:02:30.100000-->0:02:34.400000
 Do you have any suggestion? How do you find the prolific? Is it good or not?

20
0:02:35-->0:02:37.100000
 Because you have more experience than I do.

21
0:02:50.100000-->0:03:01.430000
 Really?

22
0:03:04.800000-->0:03:24.680000
 Yeah, behind. Underneath.

23
0:03:36.250000-->0:03:52.790000
 Oh, yeah.

24
0:03:54-->0:03:58.880000
 What's the other platform? Because I won't give it to one of my friends.
