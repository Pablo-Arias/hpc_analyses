 Hello, my name's Chris, and I'm from Scotland.

1
0:00:27.750000-->0:00:41.090000
 Ah, Raj, I've never been to Birmingham itself, although many years ago I spent one day in

2
0:00:41.090000-->0:00:45.190000
 Birmingham at a conference centre, but I don't know Birmingham.

3
0:00:57.180000-->0:00:58
 Oh, yes.

4
0:00:58.800000-->0:01:07.760000
 Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, and I live south of Glasgow.

5
0:01:07.800000-->0:01:12.060000
 Now, Edinburgh is on the east coast.

6
0:01:12.060000-->0:01:18.260000
 Glasgow is at a similar level, but on the west coast of Scotland.

7
0:01:18.260000-->0:01:22.880000
 I think it's about 30 miles from Edinburgh.

8
0:01:37-->0:01:41.940000
 Yeah, and may I ask, what do you do in Birmingham?

9
0:01:52.360000-->0:01:52.600000
 Ah.

10
0:01:52.600000-->0:01:56.780000
 So, is your job an office-based job?

11
0:01:58.800000-->0:02:00.260000
 You work in an office?

12
0:02:00.800000-->0:02:00.960000
 Yeah.

13
0:02:01.800000-->0:02:13.790000
 Well, yeah, I'm in my seventies now, and before I retired, I was a midwife.

14
0:02:19.850000-->0:02:22.070000
 I enjoyed being a midwife.

15
0:02:22.070000-->0:02:35.170000
 I loved helping mums delivering their babies, but it became very difficult with shift work.

16
0:02:36.050000-->0:02:44.670000
 And when the time came to retire, although I loved my job, I was ready to retire.

17
0:02:50-->0:02:50.280000
 Ah.

18
0:02:58.750000-->0:03:09.340000
 Yeah, it makes you feel tired even when you're off duty, but I loved being a midwife.

19
0:03:10.100000-->0:03:18.040000
 So, you're married?

20
0:03:24.850000-->0:03:26.750000
 I've never been married.

21
0:03:27.450000-->0:03:41.630000
 I have quite a number of close family members near to where I live, but I've never been married, and I don't have any children of my own.

22
0:03:43.450000-->0:03:50.330000
 In my younger years, I wanted to get married, but I didn't meet the right person.

23
0:04:01.140000-->0:04:10.730000
 It's been lovely chatting, and you?
