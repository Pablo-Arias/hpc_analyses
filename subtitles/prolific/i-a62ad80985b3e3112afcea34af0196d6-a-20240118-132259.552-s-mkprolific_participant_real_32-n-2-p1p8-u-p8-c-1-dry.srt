 Hiya, you okay? Yeah, yeah, not bad. Thanks. It's a bit of a weird weird task

1
0:00:29.650000-->0:00:31.570000
 Yeah, I've had what one so far

2
0:00:36.370000-->0:00:42.070000
 It's really weird when you're not given like any prompt or like topic to talk about

3
0:00:47.640000-->0:00:53.120000
 So have you got cats then? Oh wow

4
0:00:54.120000-->0:00:54.780000
 Did you?

5
0:00:55.400000-->0:00:57.340000
 Does the dog get on with the cats?

6
0:01:02.400000-->0:01:08.310000
 Okay, that's funny. I've got a dog and he really doesn't like cats

7
0:01:10.300000-->0:01:11.160000
 No

8
0:01:11.900000-->0:01:13.040000
 He's a cockapoo

9
0:01:17.260000-->0:01:17.720000
 Okay

10
0:01:21.340000-->0:01:21.900000
 Yeah

11
0:01:21.960000-->0:01:27.860000
 Yeah, I don't I mean he's never really like we've never had one in the house like for him to interact with but when he

12
0:01:27.860000-->0:01:30.020000
 Sees them outside. He goes absolutely mad

13
0:01:37.940000-->0:01:38.600000
 Okay

14
0:01:42.150000-->0:01:42.800000
 Yeah

15
0:01:51.470000-->0:01:54.370000
 No, yeah, it's a hard lesson

16
0:01:56.850000-->0:01:58.350000
 Where abouts you from?

17
0:02:00.720000-->0:02:01.220000

0:02:12.410000-->0:02:12.910000
 Yeah

21
0:02:13.750000-->0:02:19.010000
 Yeah, I had said the person I spoke to you before was like up in like really North Scotland and she was like

22
0:02:19.010000-->0:02:21.230000
 Oh, we've got a foot of snow here today. I

23
0:02:21.230000-->0:02:22.810000
 Definitely can't relate to that

24
0:02:26.250000-->0:02:29.680000
 Yeah, I mean it's really cold. But yeah, thankfully sunny

25
0:02:39.310000-->0:02:39.330000
 Yeah

26
0:02:39.330000-->0:02:43.110000
 Yeah, it's nice being able to do this from home and not having to go out in it today

27
0:02:48.050000-->0:02:55.110000
 How long have you been on prolific for? Oh, wow

28
0:02:55.250000-->0:02:57.370000

0:03:27.680000-->0:03:29.200000
 but but now

34
0:03:37.720000-->0:03:39.360000

0:03:57.650000-->0:03:58.770000
 That's great

37
0:04:00.320000-->0:04:03.740000
