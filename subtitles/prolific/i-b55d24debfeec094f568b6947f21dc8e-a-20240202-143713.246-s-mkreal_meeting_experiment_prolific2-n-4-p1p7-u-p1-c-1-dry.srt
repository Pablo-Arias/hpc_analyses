 Hiya. Hiya, I'm Raj, nice to meet you too. What are you doing at the weekend? Yeah, no

1
0:00:26.990000-->0:00:32.230000
 usually I've been in ones where they give you a topic and so not just where

2
0:00:32.230000-->0:00:37.070000
 it's just like just chit-chat, it's usually like talk about XYZ, so I signed up

3
0:00:37.070000-->0:00:42.170000
 with no knowledge of what to expect and it seemed very straightforward, so yeah.

4
0:00:42.170000-->0:01:14.610000
 Do you use Prolific a lot? No, it's alright, don't worry, it's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it makes me

5
0:01:14.610000-->0:01:19.370000
 wonder what the, like what they're trying to, what the

6
0:01:19.370000-->0:01:23.890000
 hypothesis is that they're trying to like, you know, confirm or disprove I guess,

7
0:01:23.890000-->0:01:27.930000
 but I always try and think about that when I'm doing a study, I'm like I

8
0:01:27.930000-->0:01:31.230000
 wonder what they're trying to actually get from this, because some of them are

9
0:01:31.230000-->0:01:35.210000
 really straightforward and you get it straight away, but some of them, not sure

10
0:01:35.210000-->0:01:55.720000
 and this is one of them. True, yeah, could be, could not be. Mine's pretty relaxed to be

11
0:01:55.720000-->0:01:59.900000
 honest, not anything major, might go see some family tomorrow and then just catch

12
0:01:59.900000-->0:02:04.180000
 up on some life admin as well I think, you know, when you're working in the week

13
0:02:04.180000-->0:02:19.010000
 I think, you know, sometimes things just fall by a little bit, so good to do that. I do, yeah, how about you? Oh yeah, absolutely, yeah, it's a bit quieter on a Friday

14
0:02:19.010000-->0:02:22.670000
 afternoon as well, which is why I'm like, I actually have half an hour to spare, but

15
0:02:22.670000-->0:02:46.340000
 if this is like a Tuesday, probably not. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What do you? Oh, no, it's alright, I'm in the West Midlands, so near Birmingham,

16
0:02:46.340000-->0:03:14.160000
 how about you? Oh, nice, yeah, lovely, good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, good. This is, yes, so I

17
0:03:14.160000-->0:03:21.050000
 think it's my last one from what I read at the start, how about you? Yeah, I wonder

18
0:03:21.050000-->0:03:25.780000
 if we were spoken to the same people but just in a different order, I wonder if

19
0:03:25.780000-->0:03:29.520000
 it's, or if they just mix and match it completely across, or if it's the same

20
0:03:29.520000-->0:03:40.880000
 eight people rotating? No, oh no, no one with a strong Canadian accent actually, so I've

21
0:03:40.880000-->0:03:45.700000
 assumed they're not, but I spoke to someone who was a midwife, and then I

22
0:03:45.700000-->0:03:50.320000
 spoke to someone who's currently studying and he's doing computer science,

23
0:03:50.320000-->0:03:59.630000
 but it feels like our people might be different, some of them. Yeah, well it was

24
0:03:59.630000-->0:04:07.190000
 nice speaking to you, just in the 15 seconds, but have a great weekend. Thank

25
0:04:07.190000-->0:04:08.810000
 you, have a great weekend.
