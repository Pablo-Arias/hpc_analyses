 Hello? Oh, hi. Yes, I can hear you. I couldn't hear the guy before. I know. All picture and

1
0:00:33.400000-->0:00:42.070000
 no sound. Yeah. Are you the researcher or is this just like... Oh, right. Is it just

2
0:00:42.070000-->0:00:57.770000
 like the chat with people? Oh, right. And then it's like speed dating, is it? Where

3
0:00:57.770000-->0:01:04.430000
 are you based? Oh, very good. I'm in Belfast and it's just starting to snow right now.

4
0:01:04.430000-->0:01:14.940000
 It's horrible weather here. Is yours bad? Rain, I know. Yeah, I know. It's rotten, isn't

5
0:01:14.940000-->0:01:24.480000
 it? Roll on springtime. I know. It's great what you can see a change in the night, isn't

6
0:01:24.480000-->0:01:42.640000
 it? Getting the stretch of the evenings. Is that your cat? Oh, good. I know. I'm still

7
0:01:42.640000-->0:01:47.120000
 working from home at the minute. We do two days in the office and then three days at

8
0:01:47.120000-->0:01:59.070000
 home still since Covid. So it's great. No, nothing much. Just a couple of meetings later

9
0:01:59.070000-->0:02:05.330000
 with work and then just a guy coming to service the boiler. Nothing too exciting because then

10
0:02:05.330000-->0:02:14.500000
 I think it's ready to pack in. Oh, have you? I know, but that's one thing you can't live

11
0:02:14.500000-->0:02:29.430000
 without in this weather. I know. I know. I don't know how people cope without them. Oh,

12
0:02:29.430000-->0:02:43.130000
 my God. Are you a granny? You don't look old enough. Have you? No way. Oh, my God. And

13
0:02:43.130000-->0:02:52.990000
 she doesn't use the tumble dryer even with the kids. God. Oh, and the radiators, does

14
0:02:52.990000-->0:03:03.570000
 she dry it? Oh, right. OK. I know I wouldn't cope with that. We did that in our last house

15
0:03:03.570000-->0:03:09.510000
 and caused really bad damp and condensation. So I'm traumatized from that. Yeah, really

16
0:03:09.510000-->0:03:24.130000
 bad. Oh, right. OK. And then the mold is terrible. But with children, with their chest and colds

17
0:03:24.130000-->0:03:34.680000
 and stuff, their respiratory systems. It's really bad. Yeah. Oh, my God. She's all frozen.

18
0:03:35.680000-->0:03:44.920000
 I wish I was more environmentally friendly. My carbon footprint's probably shocking. I

19
0:03:49.720000-->0:03:59.730000
 know. Something for an easy life. I know, definitely. Oh, 15 seconds. Yes, you too.

20
0:03:59.730000-->0:04:03.330000
 Take care. Hope you get sorted. Bye.
