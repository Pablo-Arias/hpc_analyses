 Hi there. How are you doing? Yeah, not bad at all. Whereabouts are you based?

1
0:00:29.200000-->0:00:47.070000
 Very quiet. Can you hear me? Oh, that's okay. Whereabouts do you live? Okay, I'm up in

2
0:00:47.070000-->0:00:57.630000
 Scotland, so other end of the country. Oh, it's beautiful. We're covered in snow

3
0:00:57.630000-->0:01:05.490000
 just now. Yeah. I think it's like minus four, but we've got about a foot of snow.

4
0:01:05.490000-->0:01:33.040000
 Oh. No. Okay. Oh no, we have to light the cold up here. We've got no option. Yeah.

5
0:01:33.040000-->0:01:41.090000
 Yeah, I would say it does, to varying sort of depths. Sometimes we'll have very little,

6
0:01:41.090000-->0:01:45.830000
 but the next time we'll have quite a bit. So we've got about a foot just now, but I

7
0:01:45.830000-->0:02:01.490000
 think that's it. I think the weather's supposed to improve. Fingers crossed. Yeah. Yeah. I've

8
0:02:01.490000-->0:02:07.390000
 got two dogs, so I just have to wrap up warm and go out, but all the kids are off school.

9
0:02:07.390000-->0:02:21.130000
 They're sledging. It's good. It's good fun. Yes. They love the snow. Cocker Spaniels.

10
0:02:21.150000-->0:02:31.340000
 Yeah. Both are Cocker Spaniels. One's a puppy. He's only four months old. Do you have any

11
0:02:31.340000-->0:03:18.780000
 pets? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All the popular breeds. Yeah. Yeah. I know. So are you on your lunch

12
0:03:18.780000-->0:03:57.850000
 break from work just now? Okay. What are you studying? Wow. That's impressive. I work for

13
0:03:57.850000-->0:04:08.190000
 the NHS as well, but I do data analysis. So yeah, not patient facing. You deserve the credit.
