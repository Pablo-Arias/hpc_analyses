 I went to grab water. It was still connecting. I'm Nima. It's good to meet you. Neat. I'm

1
0:00:31.290000-->0:00:53.310000
 well from Canada, but I live in Manchester now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My husband. Yeah. Oh,

2
0:00:55.530000-->0:01:04.870000
 but yeah, so we had initially met online and then we like he visited Canada quite a few times and

3
0:01:04.870000-->0:01:13.870000
 then we decided to take the leap and being here just made sense for us. So here we are. I miss

4
0:01:13.870000-->0:01:30.710000
 my family. I do miss aspects of Canada for sure, but mostly my family I'd say. Oh for sure. I love

5
0:01:30.710000-->0:01:36.070000
 it here. I do you know what? It's actually interesting. I don't think that there's that

6
0:01:36.070000-->0:01:44.010000
 much of a difference. I think between Canada and England. There's as far as culture. It's

7
0:01:44.010000-->0:01:49.490000
 very similar. We obviously speak the same language and you know, the people are very

8
0:01:49.490000-->0:01:53.950000
 similar. I would say especially being up North. Everybody's very kind. Everybody's welcoming.

9
0:01:53.950000-->0:02:29.580000
 It's great. Yeah. Oh, wow. No way. Okay. That's quite close to where I am. I'm in southward.

10
0:02:29.580000-->0:03:06.120000
 So far. Yeah. Right. And how did you like it? Oh, that's so sweet. Yeah, that's great. When

11
0:03:06.120000-->0:03:13.020000
 did you retire? Not at the moment. I actually have an interview on Tuesday and another one

12
0:03:13.020000-->0:03:21.890000
 on Wednesday of next week. So thank you. What about you? How's retirement treating you?

13
0:03:23.600000-->0:03:51.810000
 How's retirement treating you? Yeah. Do you get bored? Do you get bored? Yeah. Right.

14
0:04:01.100000-->0:04:06.080000
 Oh, that's lovely. I imagine I would be too. I look forward to all the time.
