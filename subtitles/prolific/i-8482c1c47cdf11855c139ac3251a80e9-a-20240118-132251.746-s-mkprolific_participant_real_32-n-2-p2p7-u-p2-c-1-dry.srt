0
0:00:07.900000-->0:00:24.630000
 I'm okay, thanks. How are you? Oh, I can hear so much better. Yeah, I had someone on before

1
0:00:24.630000-->0:00:28.390000
 and there was like major technical difficulties. I couldn't hear a word she was saying, bless

2
0:00:28.630000-->0:00:38.790000
 her. And then she froze completely. I know. I did message the people who put the survey

3
0:00:38.790000-->0:00:42.650000
 out and said to them, and they were just like, oh, just persist. And then next minute

4
0:00:42.650000-->0:00:47.710000
 it said, you've only got 15 seconds left to talk. We literally spoke about nothing. Where

5
0:00:47.710000-->0:01:06.630000
 are you from? You're from where? Ah, right, okay. No way. I'm from Glasgow. No, I don't

6
0:01:06.630000-->0:01:17.420000
 think so. That's just total coincidence. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it's the same. It's so cold.

7
0:01:17.420000-->0:01:23.100000
 It was like minus six when I got up this morning. So yeah, it's not giving us much choice but

8
0:01:23.100000-->0:01:37.040000
 to actually put the heating on, isn't it not? Which is a pain, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have

9
0:01:37.040000-->0:01:46.130000
 you got kids? No kids, just yourself. Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, I've got a wee girl. Yeah.

10
0:01:46.130000-->0:01:50.850000
 So I try and have the heating on in the morning for when she gets up so that she's warm. But

11
0:01:50.850000-->0:01:54.410000
 when it's just me, it's like, I don't need the heating. It's fine. I can have a hot,

12
0:01:54.410000-->0:02:06.080000
 I've got a hot water bottle. So yeah. I know. She's, she's 11. She's 11. So this is her

13
0:02:06.080000-->0:02:11.780000
 last year in primary school, so it is. So then she goes on to secondary school, which I'm not

14
0:02:11.780000-->0:02:20.120000
 prepared for. She's more than ready. Yeah, she's more than ready, I'm not. Oh, yeah, absolutely.

15
0:02:27.050000-->0:02:36.420000
 Yeah. Yeah. Is that your sister's daughter or your brother? Sisters? Yeah. Oh, wow. I bet she

16
0:02:36.420000-->0:02:55.030000
 tells you about the attitude as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I have nephews. My

17
0:02:55.030000-->0:03:01.070000
 sister has two boys. And my brother has two boys. So my daughter's the only girl. And honestly,

18
0:03:01.070000-->0:03:07.950000
 when I say girls are the most difficult, they really are. Like really, like the attitude is,

19
0:03:07.950000-->0:03:27.140000
 wow. The sass. Yeah. Oh, it's so true. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Definitely. I know sometimes

20
0:03:27.140000-->0:03:31.340000
 she like wants to hang about with women. Sometimes she's like, no, you're so cool,

21
0:03:31.340000-->0:03:41.050000
 get out of my room. I'm like, all right, okay. So yeah. No, definitely not. No, no. It's like

22
0:03:41.050000-->0:03:45.730000
 her school's not far from us. So when I look out the window, I can see into the playground and

23
0:03:45.730000-->0:03:51.430000
 she'll go, get away from the window in case my friends see you. And I'm like, I think I'm all

24
0:03:51.430000-->0:04:00.320000
 right. But okay then, yeah. They're going to see you. So yeah, I know. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So

25
0:04:00.320000-->0:04:09.050000
 fun times. I know. I know. You too. No, definitely. I know. They don't give you long for this, do they?
