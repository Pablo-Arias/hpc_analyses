 Hi, sorry, it keeps on disconnecting.

1
0:00:11.550000-->0:00:13.050000
 Is it just me or you?

2
0:00:13.050000-->0:00:14.950000
 You're disconnected too.

3
0:00:16.950000-->0:00:19.310000
 I don't know what's going on.

4
0:00:19.310000-->0:00:21.750000
 It's normally very good.

5
0:00:21.750000-->0:00:29.910000
 Sorry about that. Yeah, we also have a cousin.

6
0:00:29.910000-->0:00:31.870000
 A cousin of my husband is visiting.

7
0:00:31.890000-->0:00:35.130000
 So yeah, so we're just going to hang out with him and go

8
0:00:35.130000-->0:00:37.950000
 out on walks with the dogs and so on.

9
0:00:38.090000-->0:00:40.290000
 So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

10
0:00:42.670000-->0:00:46.510000
 I have one Cocker Spaniel mix

11
0:00:46.510000-->0:00:48.310000
 and the other is a Spring of Spaniel mix.

12
0:00:48.310000-->0:00:52.130000
 So they are very active and they really enjoy long walks.

13
0:01:02.830000-->0:01:04.630000
 Yeah, I like big dogs.

14
0:01:05.070000-->0:01:08.670000
 Although now, end of the winter, everything is so muddy.

15
0:01:08.670000-->0:01:12.210000
 The bigger the dog, the bigger the mess they make.

16
0:01:12.210000-->0:01:14.010000
 So you always have to kind of wash them.

17
0:01:14.750000-->0:01:16.830000
 But what can you do?

18
0:01:16.830000-->0:01:18.730000
 I mean, we let them on the furniture,

19
0:01:18.730000-->0:01:20.030000
 so you have to wash them.

20
0:01:20.030000-->0:01:21.530000
 Otherwise everything gets muddy.

21
0:01:22.870000-->0:01:23.230000
 Yeah.
