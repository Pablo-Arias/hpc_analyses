0
0:00:08.850000-->0:00:12.100000
 Yeah. How you doing?

1
0:00:13.600000-->0:00:14.940000
 I'm okay, thanks.

2
0:00:16.700000-->0:00:19.470000
 Yeah, I'm just putting on volume up a bit.

3
0:00:19.470000-->0:00:25.150000
 I do have a problem with my right ear, but I can't play in headphones at the moment.

4
0:00:25.150000-->0:00:28.670000
 Anyway, whereabouts are you?

5
0:00:28.670000-->0:00:34.300000
 Yeah.

6
0:00:34.300000-->0:00:35.800000
 Where do you live?

7
0:00:36-->0:00:38.420000
 Sorry?

8
0:00:38.500000-->0:00:42.450000
 I said where...

9
0:00:43-->0:00:45.020000
 I live in North Wales.

10
0:00:45.020000-->0:00:46.400000
 Where do you live again?

11
0:00:46.700000-->0:00:53.340000
 Oh, Edinburgh. All right. Okay, cool.

12
0:00:53.600000-->0:00:56.740000
 You've not got the accent yet.

13
0:00:57.600000-->0:01:00.260000
 I'm not too bad, thank you.

14
0:01:00.600000-->0:01:03.260000
 Yeah, I've been to Edinburgh.

15
0:01:04.600000-->0:01:06.240000
 What do I do?

16
0:01:06.240000-->0:01:07.760000
 Did you say?

17
0:01:09-->0:01:14.160000
 Well, I've got health problems, so I don't have a job at the moment.

18
0:01:14.160000-->0:01:16.480000
 What about you?

19
0:01:17.450000-->0:01:18.970000
 What do you do?

20
0:01:21.900000-->0:01:23.220000
 All right, okay.

21
0:01:28.200000-->0:01:30.100000
 All right, okay, cool.

22
0:01:31.200000-->0:01:33.400000
 What level are you in?

23
0:01:36.700000-->0:01:38.180000
 Which year are you in?

24
0:01:40.250000-->0:01:41.010000
 Sorry?

25
0:01:44.200000-->0:01:45.240000
 All right.

26
0:01:48.500000-->0:01:50.640000
 Right, that's interesting.

27
0:01:54.750000-->0:02:02.750000
 I'm originally from South Africa, which moved over in 2008.

28
0:02:06.650000-->0:02:09.250000
 Yeah, Johannesburg, actually.

29
0:02:10.750000-->0:02:12.330000
 Johannesburg?

30
0:02:16.340000-->0:02:17.820000
 In Gauteng.

31
0:02:17.820000-->0:02:19.380000
 Yeah.

32
0:02:21-->0:02:24.480000
 So we've been here about 15, 16 years now.

33
0:02:26-->0:02:34.200000
 My parents went over to visit them and the rest of my family over this month,

34
0:02:34.200000-->0:02:36.420000
 and it was very, very hot.

35
0:02:36.420000-->0:02:41.260000
 They're actually in Cape Town now, near Cape Town, and it was very hot.

36
0:02:41.260000-->0:02:43.860000
 So I don't think I can handle that heat.

37
0:02:47-->0:02:48.860000
 It must be quite different for you.

38
0:02:52-->0:02:53.060000
 Certain places.

39
0:02:58.550000-->0:02:59.750000
 Yes, definitely.

40
0:03:03.050000-->0:03:03.390000
 Yeah.

41
0:03:04.600000-->0:03:06
 Yeah, definitely.

42
0:03:06.400000-->0:03:11.760000
 Anyway, we decided we needed to move.

43
0:03:11.800000-->0:03:15.380000
 So there were lots of different decisions.

44
0:03:15.800000-->0:03:19.400000
 So when did you move over?

45
0:03:24-->0:03:26.720000
 Where are you originally from?

46
0:03:31.780000-->0:03:33.100000
 Where were you born?

47
0:03:33.100000-->0:03:38.690000
 Yeah.

48
0:03:40.450000-->0:03:42.230000
 Nigeria, right, yeah.

49
0:03:42.900000-->0:03:45.470000
 I don't know very well, but I know the name.

50
0:03:45.550000-->0:03:48.690000
 So when did you move over to the UK?

51
0:03:52.900000-->0:03:54.120000
 Three years, okay.

52
0:03:54.300000-->0:03:55.320000
 That's cool.

53
0:03:56.300000-->0:03:58.640000
 Have you got used to the weather yet?

54
0:04:02.050000-->0:04:04.010000
 Have you got used to the cold?
