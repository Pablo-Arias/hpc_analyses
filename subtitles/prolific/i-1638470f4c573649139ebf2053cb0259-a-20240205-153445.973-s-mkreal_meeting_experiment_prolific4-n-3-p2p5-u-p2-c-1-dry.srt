 Hi. Thank you. Nice to see you in person. Nice to see you.

1
0:00:23.920000-->0:00:47.760000
 Sarah. Yeah, how do you know that? Oh my god! Okay, yeah, I'm in London right now.

2
0:00:47.760000-->0:01:00.470000
 Yeah. Okay. You're from Italy, yeah? You're from Macedonia. One of my best

3
0:01:00.470000-->0:01:05.710000
 friends is Macedonia. Yeah, they are very lovely, lovely people. I met some of my

4
0:01:05.710000-->0:01:16.400000
 friends from Macedonia. Yeah, that's a lovely place. No, I'm originally from Iran, but

5
0:01:16.400000-->0:01:21.960000
 I've been out of Iran for a long period of time. I'm in London, PhD student, you

6
0:01:21.960000-->0:01:31.360000
 know. Yeah. The reason is a lot of my Italian friends also have the same

7
0:01:31.360000-->0:01:35.820000
 accent, but when you say you're from Macedonia, I remember one of my

8
0:01:35.820000-->0:01:41.700000
 close friends actually had the same accent, so I could, yeah, identify that

9
0:01:41.700000-->0:01:58.770000
 kind of accent as well. How do you find this prolific, the test? Three years! You

10
0:01:58.770000-->0:02:03.790000
 champion! I've been only for about one and a half years, but I really enjoy it.

11
0:02:03.790000-->0:02:08.490000
 I'm very busy, but in the middle of my work, especially, I'm a general programmer,

12
0:02:08.490000-->0:02:13.570000
 so when I'm doing programming, when I'm running, in the middle of that, I test. I

13
0:02:13.570000-->0:02:19.730000
 take a study and then go back. Yeah, it's very interesting, you know. I think I've

14
0:02:19.730000-->0:02:27.970000
 particularly the psychology, memory test, AI test, teaching skills, programming

15
0:02:27.970000-->0:02:33.420000
 skills. It was nice. So, do you have any suggestion? How do you find the prolific?

16
0:02:33.420000-->0:03:23.270000
 Is it good or not? Because you have more experience than I do. Oh, really? Yeah, behind.

17
0:03:23.270000-->0:03:57.900000
 Yeah, underneath. Oh, yeah. What's the other platform? Because I won't give it to

18
0:03:57.900000-->0:03:58.940000
 one of my friends.
