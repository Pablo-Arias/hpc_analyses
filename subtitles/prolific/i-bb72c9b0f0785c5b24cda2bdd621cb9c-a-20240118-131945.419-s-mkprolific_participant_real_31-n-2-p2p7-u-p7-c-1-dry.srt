 I'm I'm a student. I don't do anything cool like you do. I don't try like you. I'm a student at you know

12
0:01:54.520000-->0:01:55.760000
 Results that

13
0:01:59.290000-->0:02:00.650000
 Computer Sciences

14
0:02:03.800000-->0:02:17.090000
 Computer Sciences, I can hear you but it's breaking up a little bit. Yeah

15
0:02:17.850000-->0:02:19.570000
 Yes, I can hear you

16
0:02:21.530000-->0:02:23.230000
 So I study computer sciences

17
0:02:24.600000-->0:02:25.100000
 hmm

18
0:02:26.620000-->0:02:27.260000
 well

19
0:02:28.780000-->0:02:35.540000
 No, I'm a master student. So there's no year. It's like I've been studying for about six months

20
0:02:37.530000-->0:02:39.870000
 Six months. Yeah, um

21
0:02:40.030000-->0:02:45.130000
 It's it's it's not fun, but it's okay, I guess

22
0:02:48.490000-->0:02:48.510000
 Okay

23
0:02:48.510000-->0:02:51.370000
 Yes, a lot of hard work for me

24
0:02:52.150000-->0:02:58.750000
 I'm actually overloaded with so much to do and so much to learn and

25
0:02:59.150000-->0:03:04.230000
 It's sometimes it's like why did I start this? I don't even know

26
0:03:04.510000-->0:03:09.570000
 But I'm getting there I hope I hope I can finish

27
0:03:14.270000-->0:03:14.630000
 well

28
0:03:14.650000-->0:03:16.940000
 I'm going to build

29
0:03:17.740000-->0:03:24.780000
 Applications games. I want to build games because I love the games. I love the

30
0:03:26.700000-->0:03:30.920000
 Logic goes on behind glory limbs are gone behind the games

31
0:03:30.920000-->0:03:35.960000
 So when I play them, I'm thinking like oh, I wonder what they did to make this action to that

32
0:03:35.960000-->0:03:39.060000
 So that's what I'm going to do with my with my masters

33
0:03:39.060000-->0:03:46.700000
 that's why I'm studying so hard because I want to do what they do and turn those drawings and characters into

34
0:03:46.700000-->0:03:49.200000
 You know movements and cool

35
0:03:49.440000-->0:03:53.340000
 Sequences like that. It's something I'm looking forward to doing

36
0:03:53.340000-->0:03:59.200000
 Well right now it seems like I may not be able to do it, but I'm hoping I can

37
0:03:59.320000-->0:04:02.100000
 And our question is about to end

38
0:04:02.880000-->0:04:04.560000
 Because it's so much

39
0:04:05.400000-->0:04:08.790000
 It was lovely to meet you. Thank you so much
