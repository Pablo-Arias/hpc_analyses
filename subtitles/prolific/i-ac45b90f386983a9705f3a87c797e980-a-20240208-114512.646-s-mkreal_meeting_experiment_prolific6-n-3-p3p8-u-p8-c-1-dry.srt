0
0:00:21.620000-->0:00:22.760000
 She ain't no good like that.

1
0:00:22.800000-->0:00:32.620000
 You see what I follow talk last night?

2
0:00:32.800000-->0:00:37.100000
 One black person take Canada, one white person shot.

3
0:00:39.750000-->0:00:48.160000
 She wear black like this, black hoodie.

4
0:00:52.150000-->0:00:56.010000
 Black, maybe another person.

5
0:00:59.330000-->0:01:00.450000
 Maybe she might be the one.

6
0:01:04.100000-->0:01:04.820000
 One lady.

7
0:01:08.140000-->0:01:09.360000
 Okay, another guy too.

8
0:01:09.360000-->0:01:11.620000
 This was the first person they gave me.

9
0:01:11.620000-->0:01:13.560000
 First person they gave me.

10
0:01:14-->0:01:15.700000
 Now my friend, like my friend.

11
0:01:15.700000-->0:01:17.940000
 She didn't stay.

12
0:01:19.980000-->0:01:20.040000
 She didn't stay.

13
0:01:20.040000-->0:01:22.220000
 She didn't stay from my neighborhood.

14
0:01:25.310000-->0:01:26.330000
 I did serious.

15
0:01:27.720000-->0:01:28.640000
 You're normal now.

16
0:01:29.100000-->0:01:30.260000
 I serve you now.

17
0:01:31.100000-->0:01:33.940000
 When I first, she would tell me go enter this study.

18
0:01:33.940000-->0:01:35.880000
 Because I tell her I don't see study.

19
0:01:35.880000-->0:01:38.080000
 Maybe five, this thing.

20
0:01:38.080000-->0:01:39.280000
 So she come to me.

21
0:01:39.280000-->0:01:40.800000
 She said you know if you enter, I'm there.

22
0:01:41.100000-->0:01:42.720000
 So as I said, I don't do like.

23
0:01:44.280000-->0:01:46.100000
 I be like.

24
0:01:48.020000-->0:01:49.380000
 I swear that kind of thing.

25
0:01:50-->0:01:51.280000
 I first look at her.

26
0:01:51.700000-->0:01:52.960000
 So if you pay a person like this.

27
0:02:00.540000-->0:02:01.880000
 I don't bully yourself.

28
0:02:04.770000-->0:02:05.710000
 I don't bully yourself.

29
0:02:06.830000-->0:02:07.770000
 I just did.

30
0:02:07.770000-->0:02:09.250000
 I'm sure they find money.

31
0:02:11.960000-->0:02:12.600000
 For.

32
0:02:13.720000-->0:02:15
 It was Legos actually.

33
0:02:15.500000-->0:02:16.820000
 But you know I'm high school at Akure.

34
0:02:21.200000-->0:02:22.220000
 Full town now.

35
0:02:26.350000-->0:02:28.870000
 This set.

36
0:02:28.870000-->0:02:29.550000
 We just sign out.

37
0:02:33.700000-->0:02:35.580000
 Which department?

38
0:02:40.980000-->0:02:41
 Biology.

39
0:02:41.420000-->0:02:42.620000
 Just they come back from IT.

40
0:02:44.670000-->0:02:45.230000
 Yes now.

41
0:02:45.230000-->0:02:46.910000
 So.

42
0:02:47.830000-->0:02:48.830000
 For Legos.

43
0:02:52.300000-->0:02:53.850000
 Legos based TV.

44
0:02:59.960000-->0:03:00.320000
 I watch.

45
0:03:00.400000-->0:03:01.640000
 I'm full bro.

46
0:03:02.400000-->0:03:03.760000
 Just day off.

47
0:03:04.800000-->0:03:06.160000
 Mind day off.

48
0:03:06.400000-->0:03:08.440000
 As they just come out that second goal.

49
0:03:08.440000-->0:03:09.940000
 With score first like this.

50
0:03:10.400000-->0:03:11.720000
 When they go give those penalty.

51
0:03:13.930000-->0:03:15.150000
 Nobody expect them.

52
0:03:16.800000-->0:03:18.570000
 Nobody expect them at all.

53
0:03:18.930000-->0:03:20.730000
 But we shall thank God.

54
0:03:20.730000-->0:03:21.630000
 We get good keeper.

55
0:03:22.950000-->0:03:23.850000
 The guy keep on.

56
0:03:26.360000-->0:03:26.800000
 He try.

57
0:03:29.250000-->0:03:29.830000
 No manner.

58
0:03:30.550000-->0:03:31.230000
 That kind of thing.

59
0:03:33-->0:03:33.760000
 So everything shall deal right.

60
0:03:36.450000-->0:03:38.090000
 This one reach.

61
0:03:38.450000-->0:03:39.170000
 4 minutes now.

62
0:03:41.500000-->0:03:43.760000
 One remain for you after this one.

63
0:03:47.140000-->0:03:48.540000
 Relaxing everybody.

64
0:03:51.900000-->0:03:54.690000
 My system shall soon die.

65
0:04:01.930000-->0:04:01.950000
 Well.

66
0:04:01.950000-->0:04:02.930000
 See you later my bro.
