 Hiya. How are you? Good, thanks. My first conversation didn't load and I was panicking,

1
0:00:22.840000-->0:00:30.370000
 thinking it was something at my end. Has yours been running smoothly? Yeah. All right. Where

2
0:00:30.370000-->0:00:39.130000
 are you from then? Where are you based? Right. Oh, very good. I'm in Belfast at the minute.

3
0:00:39.130000-->0:00:50.910000
 I'm saying it's just freezing cold at the minute. It's starting to snow. You'll be well

4
0:00:50.910000-->0:01:17.320000
 used to the snow from Russia. How are you? I know. The world is at a standstill. I know. I know.

5
0:01:17.320000-->0:01:26.120000
 My daughter goes to ice skating lessons and over at the rink, literally all the teachers are from

6
0:01:26.120000-->0:01:58.200000
 Russia. So do you skate it like all year round? Right. Really? Oh, God. It just came back to you.

7
0:01:58.200000-->0:02:04.820000
 I would love. I literally can't even stand on the ice. I'm so, so bad. Are there ice rinks

8
0:02:04.820000-->0:02:40.830000
 everywhere near you at home then? Yeah. Right. Oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah. And that's it.

9
0:02:50.850000-->0:03:01.750000
 I know. I know. Oh, God. That must really make you laugh. The fact that everybody gets so obsessed

10
0:03:01.750000-->0:03:17.180000
 if they've got like two inches of snow. I know. Oh, God. I know. That's it. I know. I remember

11
0:03:17.180000-->0:03:23.060000
 when I was 18 with school, I went to Romania and it was like minus 12 or something. And when you

12
0:03:23.060000-->0:03:28.280000
 were walking, you were literally in like two feet of snow. It was absolutely gorgeous. I love the

13
0:03:28.280000-->0:03:40.600000
 snow. It's so beautiful to look at, isn't it? It's OK as long as you're well wrapped up, like

14
0:03:40.600000-->0:03:45.640000
 hopped up and everything. And then it was such an ordeal walking through the snow. You're nearly

15
0:03:45.640000-->0:03:50.760000
 warming yourself up, trying to navigate through it. Do you know what I mean? Because it's like

16
0:03:50.760000-->0:03:56.340000
 you're trudging through it. So I enjoyed it. Yeah. And I can't cope with cold. I hate being

17
0:03:56.340000-->0:04:05.070000
 cold here. I'm always freezing. So here we go again. Lovely talking to you. Bye.
