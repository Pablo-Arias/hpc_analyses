0:00:00-->0:00:21.070000
 Hey, hello. Can you hear me? Oh, brilliant. Yeah, I can. And luckily, you're the only the second person that there were a lot of technical problems at the beginning.

1
0:00:24.200000-->0:00:30.260000
 Yes, yeah, the first person, she couldn't hear me and couldn't connect. Then I got a big white screen for ages and nothing happened.

2
0:00:32.900000-->0:00:35.340000
 And the third person came and that just about worked. So, yeah, I don't know how many we're supposed to be talking to.

3
0:00:35.340000-->0:00:46.520000
 I don't know how many. All right. All right. Oh, OK. And no problems.

4
0:00:49.450000-->0:00:52.650000
 Oh, I don't know why some of it works and some of it doesn't. But anyway, nice to see you.

5
0:00:52.650000-->0:00:58.570000
 And whereabouts are you in the world? Where do you live? Brentwood.

6
0:01:01.250000-->0:01:07.580000
 All right. I mean, I'm near Brentford, which is in London. Brentford.

7
0:01:07.580000-->0:01:16.570000
 Yeah. Yeah. So have you had a nice what day is it? Monday. Do you have a nice weekend? Do you do anything nice?

8
0:01:22.250000-->0:01:38.550000
 Oh, what's that to do in Brentwood? What's what's what's nice in Brentwood?

9
0:01:42.200000-->0:02:03.080000
 Hmm. Oh, yeah, I've never been, but worth checking out.

10
0:02:03.080000-->0:02:08.420000
 Yeah, I went up to near Manchester to see some old school friends. There was a party.

11
0:02:08.420000-->0:02:12.220000
 And luckily I got there because there was a train strike on the Saturday.

12
0:02:12.220000-->0:02:19.280000
 But I got up on Friday and I saw some elderly aunts of mine that I've not seen for a while and could be the last time I see them.

13
0:02:19.280000-->0:02:23.920000
 So it was nice to see them. And then Saturday was just great. It was a really good party.

14
0:02:23.920000-->0:02:29.100000
 And my friend, an old school friend, and she had all her family and friends from all over.

15
0:02:29.100000-->0:02:34.720000
 And it was major. It was great fun. It was a real disco and everyone was having a really good time.

16
0:02:34.720000-->0:02:39.340000
 But on Sunday I was aching all over because I was thinking, oh, I'm not 21 anymore.

17
0:02:40.300000-->0:02:44.820000
 I've got to remember the spirit strong, but the body's weak.

18
0:02:45.300000-->0:02:51.600000
 But it was good fun. It was it was nice. So it's nice to do things like that every now and then.

19
0:02:51.600000-->0:02:59.130000
 It's like, yeah, I do something a bit. How long? Oh, yeah, I think it's about eight months.

20
0:02:59.130000-->0:03:03.550000
 I think I was trying to work it out. I do lots, lots of surveys. I was just talking to the last chap.

21
0:03:03.550000-->0:03:09.130000
 And some of them are really interesting and some of them are not. So I mean, all the best ones usually get snapped up.

22
0:03:09.130000-->0:03:12.690000
 I mean, I like these sort of video ones because they're a bit different, aren't they?

23
0:03:12.690000-->0:03:16.890000
 But all the all the good ones get snapped up very quickly.

24
0:03:16.890000-->0:03:23.450000
 So most of them are worth 10. Yeah, lots of them are worth like 10p or whatever.

25
0:03:23.450000-->0:03:29.010000
 But it's good. It's just interesting to do some of them. They make you think about things sometimes, don't they?

26
0:03:29.150000-->0:03:34.610000
 But I would say a lot of them now are training AI, artificial intelligence.

27
0:03:34.610000-->0:03:38.930000
 And it's kind of like lots of that chat bots. And that scares me a bit.

28
0:03:38.930000-->0:03:42.330000
 It's like I don't want to be training AI to be more human.

29
0:03:42.330000-->0:03:47.170000
 It's like we're going to lose all our jobs and everything and robots will take over.

30
0:03:50.150000-->0:03:57.400000
 Yeah. Well, when you when you're dealing with them online, is it finishing soon?

31
0:03:57.400000-->0:04:01.960000
 Hang on. Oh, bye bye. I'm Anne-Marie. And you are?

32
0:04:04.650000-->0:04:09.720000
 Yago Da. Where's that from? Oh, fabulous.
