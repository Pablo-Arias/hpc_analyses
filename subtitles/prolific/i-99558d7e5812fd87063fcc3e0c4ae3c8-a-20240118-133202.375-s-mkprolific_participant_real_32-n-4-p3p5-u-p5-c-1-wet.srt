0:00:10.520000-->0:00:13.330000
 Hello, hello. Can you hear me?

1
0:00:13.370000-->0:00:20.870000
 Yeah. My name is Annette and I'm from Exeter.

2
0:00:20.870000-->0:00:30.310000
 What about you? Oh, wow.

3
0:00:31.200000-->0:00:37.820000
 All the people I've spoken to today are from either up north or they are in Scotland.

4
0:00:37.820000-->0:00:40.800000
 I'm the only person from Southern England,

5
0:00:40.800000-->0:00:43.280000
 which is like, what are the odds, so weird.

6
0:00:43.880000-->0:00:46.600000
 Had one lady from Derbyshire,

7
0:00:46.600000-->0:00:50.420000
 then Aberdeen, Glasgow, and then you live in Preston.

8
0:00:52.060000-->0:00:54.820000
 Yeah, what are the odds?

9
0:00:54.820000-->0:00:56.380000
 So how did you find the UK?

10
0:00:56.380000-->0:00:57.880000
 How long have you lived here?

11
0:00:57.940000-->0:01:05.340000
 Chill.

12
0:01:05.700000-->0:01:16.710000
 That's cool. So whereabouts from Nigeria are you?

13
0:01:18.520000-->0:01:27.620000
 No, so I had a friend at uni and she was from Lagos.

14
0:01:27.620000-->0:01:29.520000
 So that was an easy one.

15
0:01:29.520000-->0:01:30.660000
 Lagos? Yeah.

16
0:01:30.660000-->0:01:48.490000
 So, yeah, that's the only ones I know, like the big ones.

17
0:02:00.280000-->0:02:02.460000
 I know that it's a federation.

18
0:02:03.640000-->0:02:07.380000
 I know that Nigeria is a federation and states and stuff.

19
0:02:07.380000-->0:02:09.960000
 Yeah. I don't know like details, but yeah.

20
0:02:10.040000-->0:02:14.660000
 Yeah, I always said to my friend from Nigeria, like I like to like visit one day.

21
0:02:14.660000-->0:02:17.220000
 But it's like, it's just so like random.

22
0:02:17.220000-->0:02:21.240000
 I know like tourists to Nigeria, I know like holidays to Nigeria.

23
0:02:21.240000-->0:02:25.040000
 You know, I don't know where to like start, like just go to Nigeria.

24
0:02:25.040000-->0:02:25.660000
 So random.

25
0:02:41.910000-->0:02:45.310000
 Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice.

26
0:02:46.210000-->0:02:47.210000
 Yeah, definitely.

27
0:02:47.210000-->0:02:50.470000
 All the people, like the Nigerians I met, because I with my friend,

28
0:02:50.470000-->0:02:53.170000
 like she took me like to Nigerian church and stuff.

29
0:02:53.630000-->0:02:58.870000
 And I just like found the people like really warm, like really like easy to talk to

30
0:02:58.870000-->0:03:00.550000
 and like really down to earth.

31
0:03:00.550000-->0:03:03.470000
 It just felt like, yeah, you know, they're like really nice and everything.

32
0:03:03.470000-->0:03:06.390000
 So it'd be nice to like actually go there.

33
0:03:06.390000-->0:03:13.750000
 But yeah, maybe when I save up money, then I can afford going there.

34
0:03:13.750000-->0:03:16.130000
 But yeah, it's just the flight tickets, isn't it?

35
0:03:16.130000-->0:03:16.870000
 It's quite expensive.

36
0:03:16.870000-->0:03:20.010000
 But I guess once you're there, it's fine, isn't it?

37
0:03:20.010000-->0:03:22.630000
 But yeah, just trying to get there.

38
0:03:27.220000-->0:03:31.120000
 So I am from Slovakia originally.

39
0:03:31.120000-->0:03:34.640000
 So I don't know whether you know where Slovakia is, but it's like in the middle of Europe.

40
0:03:34.640000-->0:03:36.260000
 It's like Central Europe. It's fine.

41
0:03:36.260000-->0:03:39.500000
 And so because it's like in the middle.

42
0:03:40.020000-->0:03:43.320000
 So I've visited lots of countries when I was like a child.

43
0:03:43.320000-->0:03:45.340000
 It's like 10 minutes to Hungary.

44
0:03:45.340000-->0:03:47.600000
 Like I'm not joking, like with a car.

45
0:03:47.600000-->0:03:50.020000
 And it's like an hour to Poland, you know.

46
0:03:50.220000-->0:03:53.100000
 So I like I visited those countries already.

47
0:03:54.350000-->0:04:01.660000
 Yeah. So I would like to go like more further away, you know, from like Europe and just like, I don't know.

48
0:04:01.660000-->0:04:05.020000
 I was thinking like Canada maybe as well and Mexico.

49
0:04:06.120000-->0:04:07.860000
 What about you? Where would you like to go?
