 Hi, how are you? Good, thank you. My name is Jasmina. What's your name? Sue, nice to meet you.

1
0:00:30.800000-->0:00:32.920000
 Where are you from?

2
0:00:40.780000-->0:00:41.480000
 Kenya.

3
0:00:41.500000-->0:00:59.700000
 Sorry? Yes, yes, of course, yes. The sound is not the best, or the internet, yes. I do, I do know where Leeds is. I am living in London, so.

4
0:01:05.250000-->0:01:08.050000
 Can you please repeat, sorry?

5
0:01:12.450000-->0:01:25.810000
 I'm working from home, actually. I'm doing, offering program, online sessions for people that are suffering anxiety and panic attacks.

6
0:01:25.810000-->0:01:38.830000
 So, yes, that's part of my engagement, and also I'm doing online testings, etc., just to fill in the time. And how about you?

7
0:01:41.920000-->0:01:42.700000
 Ah, okay.

8
0:01:43.100000-->0:02:16.430000
 Yes, and how you find that you changed now to work remotely? Do you prefer that? Do you like it?

9
0:02:36.230000-->0:02:37.650000
 Yes, exactly.

10
0:02:49.760000-->0:02:57.420000
 Well, you mentioned that you are having a disability, yes?

11
0:02:58.950000-->0:03:10.580000
 Yes, I am also, I'm a wheelchair user, and for me as well, it's much easier that I am working from home. So, definitely it's better than traveling.

12
0:03:10.600000-->0:03:23.060000
 And especially in London, it's such a big and crowded city, if I need to commute, that would be crazy on a daily basis. So, yes, I really like it.

13
0:03:25.550000-->0:03:35.890000
 Yes, indeed. And tell me, what, are you a wheelchair user, or what disability do you have?

14
0:03:43.050000-->0:03:50.350000
 So, okay. And if you don't mind asking me, what is your condition?

15
0:03:56.520000-->0:03:56.960000
 Okay.

16
0:04:03.700000-->0:04:09.730000
 Well, of course, of course, life goes on.
