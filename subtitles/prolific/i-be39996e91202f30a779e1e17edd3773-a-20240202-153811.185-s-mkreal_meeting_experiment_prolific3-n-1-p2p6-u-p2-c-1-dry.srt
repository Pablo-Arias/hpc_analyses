0:00:12.550000-->0:00:23.200000
 hi I'm good thank you can you hear me okay so I just want to check yeah I can

1
0:00:23.200000-->0:00:40.070000
 hear you I'm London I've lived here all my life was born here what about you I

2
0:00:58.960000-->0:01:05.230000
 haven't it's one of like the barbers on like the outer edge of it yeah you know

3
0:01:05.230000-->0:01:18.010000
 cowboys school and that's kind of yeah it's an interesting area um you have on

4
0:01:18.010000-->0:01:22.050000
 the hill is like a really really nice area so is Pinner but then you kind of

5
0:01:22.050000-->0:01:26.310000
 go to like real stone side and it was kind of the areas you're told not to go

6
0:01:26.310000-->0:01:40.190000
 alone growing up yeah yeah yeah it's kind of weird you walk like 20 minutes in

7
0:01:40.190000-->0:01:44.450000
 Harrow and you end up yeah somewhere completely different it honestly is

8
0:01:44.450000-->0:01:59.530000
 bizarre um not like when I was growing up we didn't really go very often but

9
0:01:59.530000-->0:02:04.170000
 when I started university I went to university in London so it was really

10
0:02:04.170000-->0:02:08.310000
 convenient I could live a home and save on rent which I was very grateful for

11
0:02:08.310000-->0:02:34.710000
 have you been to London much I've always wanted to visit more places in the UK

12
0:02:38.900000-->0:02:52.990000
 same same yes I'm doing my master's last year classics I'm nearly done with it

13
0:02:52.990000-->0:02:57.790000
 just my like two or three more months of studying and then my dissertation and

14
0:02:57.790000-->0:03:09.390000
 then I'm done thank God oh that's that's the million-dollar question I wish I

15
0:03:09.390000-->0:03:15.810000
 knew yeah I'm a little terrified I can't lie I like in theory everyone says like

16
0:03:15.810000-->0:03:19.410000
 oh it's like a transferable degree but then part of me feels like they're

17
0:03:19.410000-->0:03:32.570000
 saying that to make you feel a bit better that's true that's true I'm like

18
0:03:32.570000-->0:03:42.950000
 fingers crossed it goes smoothly oh no that's fine honestly absolutely like

19
0:03:42.950000-->0:03:47.450000
 don't blame me people say university is like the be-all end-all like kind of the

20
0:03:47.450000-->0:04:01.350000
 route everyone should go but I really disagree yeah it was nice talking to you

21
0:04:01.350000-->0:04:08.910000
 yeah I didn't realize I was four minutes I was really confused okay bye bye
