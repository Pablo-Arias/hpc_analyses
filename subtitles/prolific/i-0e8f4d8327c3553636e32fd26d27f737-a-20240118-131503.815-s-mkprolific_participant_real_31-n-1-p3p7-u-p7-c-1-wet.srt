 Hello. Yes, I can hear you fine. Can you hear me? Okay. My name is Faith.

1
0:00:31.360000-->0:00:49.710000
 Hi Martha. Um, where are you? I'm in Manchester. Yeah, I'm in Manchester

2
0:00:49.710000-->0:01:03.490000
 northwest. Oh, I'm a student. I'm a student at the University of Manchester.

3
0:01:03.490000-->0:01:11.160000
 What about you? Ah, computing. I'm dying.

4
0:01:14.350000-->0:01:29.450000
 Yes, computer science. I'm dying from the workload. I have no idea yet, but I will figure

5
0:01:29.450000-->0:01:34.730000
 it out. Something definitely in, in, I don't even know what I want to do with my life,

6
0:01:34.730000-->0:02:02.720000
 I say. Um, I'm trying to figure it out little by little. What about you? Well, cool. You

7
0:02:02.720000-->0:02:12.100000
 try. I don't think I can deal with all that. I hate maths normally. I don't even know how

8
0:02:12.280000-->0:02:24.360000
 I'm good at coding, but I do not like maths. I don't, I don't know. I'm very good at HTML,

9
0:02:24.360000-->0:02:31.620000
 CSS, JavaScript. I know those, but when they put like fractions in front of me, like, no,

10
0:02:32.120000-->0:02:47.180000
 don't please. No, thank you. It's, you can call it number. Yes. I work with numbers,

11
0:02:47.180000-->0:02:54.240000
 but the computer kind of does that. All I do is nudge it to do what I'm telling you to do. So

12
0:02:54.240000-->0:03:00.480000
 it's, it's pretty simple, especially since they are like cheat codes. You can type on chat GPT

13
0:03:00.480000-->0:03:07.240000
 to help me or co-pilots help me, um, code what I'm trying to code. And it's pretty simple. It's

14
0:03:07.240000-->0:03:14.820000
 not hard at all. Once you have the basics down pat, you can do it. I've been, I was working for

15
0:03:14.820000-->0:03:21.860000
 a tech company before I started my program here at Manchester. So, um, it was, it was pretty

16
0:03:21.860000-->0:03:34.020000
 simple at the beginning, but now it's like lots of research, lots of, please let me be in my computer

17
0:03:34.020000-->0:03:54.290000
 room typing, you know? So yeah, I find it to be, yeah, yes. Yeah. Yes. But then when you're here

18
0:03:54.290000-->0:04:01.430000
 at school, it seems, Oh, our conversation is about to end. When you're at school, it seems like you

19
0:04:01.430000-->0:04:06.770000
 don't really know what you're doing because they are telling you so many things, so many information.

20
0:04:06.770000-->0:04:09.870000
 So right now it feels like I don't know.
