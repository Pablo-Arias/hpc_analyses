 Oh, hi. I wasn't sure if other people were joining us.

1
0:00:37.040000-->0:00:42.460000
 Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Whereabouts are you?

2
0:00:47.170000-->0:00:47.490000
 Sorry?

3
0:00:47.490000-->0:00:54.370000
 Oh, my family. Oh, very, very good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4
0:00:54.370000-->0:00:58.530000
 They live all over. I'm in England. They live all over the place.

5
0:00:58.530000-->0:01:01.930000
 So, yeah, I travel a lot to go and see them. What about you?

6
0:01:01.930000-->0:01:14.490000
 How are your family?

7
0:01:14.750000-->0:01:24.570000
 Good. And whereabouts are you?

8
0:01:24.570000-->0:01:28.740000
 Where are you?

9
0:01:38.500000-->0:01:42.170000
 Oh, right. I'm just interested, that's all.

10
0:01:42.950000-->0:01:48.930000
 I live near Manchester, where all the footballers are.

11
0:01:56.900000-->0:02:10.880000
 Yes, yeah, sure. Oh, sorry. Share WhatsApp contact?

12
0:02:10.880000-->0:02:15.640000
 No, I think we have to stay on this, don't we? We have to stay on Prolific.

13
0:02:17.190000-->0:02:17.510000
 Yeah.

14
0:02:17.650000-->0:02:24.460000
 Yeah. I can hear lots of children.

15
0:02:35-->0:02:35.800000
 Oh, wow.

16
0:02:39.500000-->0:02:42.060000
 My son is 32.

17
0:02:48.700000-->0:02:50.900000
 Yes, yes.

18
0:02:51.900000-->0:02:58.780000
 Yes. How old are you?

19
0:03:01.990000-->0:03:04.870000
 No, I'm 62.

20
0:03:08.950000-->0:03:12.160000
 So, big difference.

21
0:03:20.750000-->0:03:23.070000
 Call me grandmum.

22
0:03:29.700000-->0:03:35.420000
 Oh, I don't care. I don't care. I've just come out of hospital.

23
0:03:35.420000-->0:03:42.820000
 I've been in hospital for a really serious operation and I don't care about my age.

24
0:03:42.820000-->0:03:44.580000
 Just live every day.

25
0:03:48.850000-->0:03:53.870000
 So, so. So, so. We shall see.

26
0:03:53.870000-->0:03:58.750000
 Anyway, it looks like we're ending. So, lovely talking to you.

27
0:04:03.350000-->0:04:04.530000
 Yeah, good.
