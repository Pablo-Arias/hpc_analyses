 Hi. I'm so sorry about that. I switched it off by mistake. Can you hear me? I'm sorry

1
0:00:17.070000-->0:00:23.250000
 about that. Yeah, I can. I'm just going to, I really am going to turn the sound off. Let

2
0:00:23.250000-->0:00:27.610000
 me turn my headphones up a little bit. That's it. Right. Yeah. So what, do we just have

3
0:00:27.610000-->0:00:46.320000
 to talk to each other? Yeah. No. Well, hi. Whereabouts do you live? Kent. Sorry? Yeah.

4
0:00:46.320000-->0:00:56.550000
 I'm in South London, in Clapham. Yeah, yeah. Oh, my. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. I don't know

5
0:00:56.550000-->0:01:15.020000
 the area at all, but is it a nice place to live? Yeah. Is it? Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, maybe

6
0:01:15.020000-->0:01:20
 I would because I always think, wouldn't it be nice to move out of London? But I think

7
0:01:20-->0:01:33.750000
 if I did move out, I might find it boring. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I bet it is. Yeah. It couldn't

8
0:01:33.750000-->0:01:38.720000
 be more expensive. Yeah. Well, sadly, I live just around the corner. You heard about that

9
0:01:38.720000-->0:01:43.880000
 awful attack in the street the other day. Did you hear about the man who attacked a

10
0:01:43.880000-->0:01:50.040000
 woman? It's just around the corner from me. Yeah. So at the moment, I'm thinking, oh,

11
0:01:50.040000-->0:01:59.610000
 I really don't want to live here, but, you know, I'll probably change my mind. Yeah,

12
0:01:59.610000-->0:02:09.730000
 I know. It's horrible. Well, I was in Brixton for about 20 years and then I moved here 17

13
0:02:09.730000-->0:02:15.330000
 years ago. So in South London, quite a long time. And I grew up in Croydon, so I've always

14
0:02:15.330000-->0:02:38.350000
 been around South London. Oh, right. Yeah. Oh, it's funny, isn't it? You get stuck, really.

15
0:02:39.250000-->0:02:45.230000
 Well, I'm lucky enough to have a housing association flat, so I'd be a fool to move, really, because,

16
0:02:45.230000-->0:02:53.150000
 you know, it's nice, it's secure and quite nice neighbours and everything. So I'd probably

17
0:02:53.150000-->0:03:01.720000
 stay here forever. Yeah. Are you working? Have you got family to look after? What do

18
0:03:01.720000-->0:03:13.870000
 you do with your time? Yeah. Right. Very wise. Yeah. No, I haven't got children either. I've

19
0:03:13.870000-->0:03:21.730000
 just got a very demanding dog. Conversation over in 15 seconds. I know it was, wasn't it? Well,

20
0:03:21.730000-->0:03:26.950000
 very nice to meet you anyway. It's so weird. So weird.
