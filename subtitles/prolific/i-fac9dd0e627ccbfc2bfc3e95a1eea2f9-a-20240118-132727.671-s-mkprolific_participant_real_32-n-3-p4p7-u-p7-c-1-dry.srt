 Hello, I'm good thank you, how are you?

1
0:00:20.040000-->0:00:26.420000
 It's quite strange isn't it, you get to know people and then as soon as that 15 seconds

2
0:00:26.420000-->0:00:29.940000
 comes on you're like mid-conversation then it's just never see that person ever again.

3
0:00:38.720000-->0:00:45.620000
 Me too actually, yeah, and I did, the first girl I spoke to she was really local to where

4
0:00:45.620000-->0:00:50.160000
 I live, but then the second girl I spoke to was right at the top of the country, I guess

5
0:00:50.160000-->0:00:54.680000
 we're all in the UK, that's all I can really like conclude about it as all.

6
0:00:58.700000-->0:01:08.980000
 Oh okay, yeah so the girl I just spoke to is from Glasgow, yeah she was saying how freezing

7
0:01:08.980000-->0:01:10.520000
 she is, she was sat with a hot water bottle.

8
0:01:14.510000-->0:01:15.170000
 Have you?

9
0:01:16.550000-->0:01:26.540000
 Wow, oh gosh yeah because we had a little, yeah but just not nice to be outside in, yeah

10
0:01:26.540000-->0:01:31.060000
 we had a little bit of snow a few days ago for one day and everything was cancelled and

11
0:01:31.060000-->0:01:36.080000
 all the schools were shut and because we can't cope with the weather at all can we?

12
0:01:45.830000-->0:01:46.170000
 Yeah.

13
0:01:48.900000-->0:01:54.200000
 Ah so what's your plans for the rest of the day then, will you go out in the snow at all

14
0:01:54.200000-->0:01:55.900000
 or will you just stay in and stay warm?

15
0:01:57.910000-->0:02:06.680000
 Oh, oh I bet they do, what dogs have you got?

16
0:02:06.680000-->0:02:20.660000
 I've got one of my own as well, cute, ah do you know what that's really interesting because

17
0:02:20.660000-->0:02:24.740000
 I know we don't have long but could you tell me about what that was like when you brought

18
0:02:24.740000-->0:02:28.740000
 the puppy because I've got a four-year-old Labrador and I'm desperate to get another

19
0:02:28.740000-->0:02:32.380000
 but I'm so scared on what they're going to be like together, did you find it okay when

20
0:02:32.380000-->0:02:32.960000
 you got a puppy?

21
0:02:40.240000-->0:03:26.630000
 Right, oh it's a big jump from one to two, yeah, oh no he's got loads of energy, oh but

22
0:03:26.630000-->0:03:30.370000
 they grow up so quickly don't they, puppies do like they're literally a puppy for like

23
0:03:30.370000-->0:03:38.970000
 a second and then they're fully grown, oh yeah well I spoke to someone who'd done it

24
0:03:38.970000-->0:03:42.470000
 and they said you already go out on a walk every day and you feed your dog every day

25
0:03:42.470000-->0:03:47.290000
 and it's just a case of grabbing another collar and a lead, grabbing another bowl and just

26
0:03:47.290000-->0:03:51.510000
 doing everything you're doing just that second time so okay you've convinced me I'll go buy

27
0:03:51.510000-->0:04:05.090000
 another dog, oh yeah and the insurance and everything but they're worth it, nice, good

28
0:04:05.090000-->0:04:09.860000
 yeah like little brothers, yeah nice to meet you anyway it might end as soon.
