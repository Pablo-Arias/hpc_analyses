 Hi there, I'm good thank you. How are you today? I'm Sue. Sue, where are you based?

1
0:00:36.530000-->0:00:45.360000
 I'm in Leeds at the moment in the UK. Do you know Leeds at all? Do you know where

2
0:00:45.360000-->0:01:02.810000
 Leeds is in the north of England? All right, all right yes and what do you do

3
0:01:02.810000-->0:01:39.400000
 in London, Yasmeen? What do you do in London? What job do you do? All right, I'm

4
0:01:40.440000-->0:01:48.650000
 a counsellor. Yes, I used to be the head of the counselling service at the

5
0:01:48.650000-->0:01:54.570000
 University but I left that role about five, six years ago to get better life

6
0:01:54.570000-->0:01:59.950000
 balance and I just work remotely from home now and I do supervision of other

7
0:01:59.950000-->0:02:05.870000
 counsellors and a bit of consultancy work for organisations but yeah it's a

8
0:02:05.870000-->0:02:21.720000
 it's fulfilling work isn't it? I think it has advantages and disadvantages. I

9
0:02:21.720000-->0:02:29.340000
 think that you do lose a little bit of the therapeutic relationship don't you

10
0:02:29.340000-->0:02:34.080000
 with not having a presence but on the other hand it makes it a lot more

11
0:02:34.080000-->0:02:41.460000
 accessible for a lot of people doesn't it? And I'm disabled so it's a lot easier

12
0:02:41.460000-->0:02:47.980000
 for me you know being able to work from home as well so yeah advantages and

13
0:02:47.980000-->0:03:24.270000
 disadvantages really. What about yourself? How do you find it? Yeah, scary. We have a

14
0:03:24.270000-->0:03:40.400000
 lot in common. Yeah, I use crutches all the time and a wheelchair when I have to

15
0:03:40.400000-->0:03:52.990000
 go further than you know a few hundred meters sort of thing so yeah. Yeah, I had

16
0:03:52.990000-->0:04:02.730000
 surgery that went wrong about 25 years ago and it's left me with CRPS so yeah

17
0:04:02.730000-->0:04:08.270000
 but you know we get on with it don't we? We just get on with it.
