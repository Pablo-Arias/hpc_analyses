 Hi there. I just caught you with a mouthful. That's fine. No worries, I'll start. I'm Sue, I live in Leeds and I came to

1
0:00:31.470000-->0:00:37.350000
 university in Leeds in 1989 and ended up staying here and I obviously work here

2
0:00:37.350000-->0:00:51.080000
 now. Where are you in the UK? Manchester, near Manchester, Cheshire area. Oh, really? Whereabouts in

3
0:00:51.080000-->0:01:19.540000
 Manchester? Oh, brilliant. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, brilliant. So, are you enjoying life in the UK? Yeah, there's a lot going on, isn't there?

4
0:01:19.540000-->0:01:24.760000
 Quite a lot of culture. I'm very multicultural and I like that about it. Leeds is

5
0:01:24.760000-->0:01:32.130000
 very much the same as well. I think I came to university, I made a lot of

6
0:01:32.130000-->0:01:39.430000
 friends and I like, I just really like the fact that 15 minutes one way you can

7
0:01:39.430000-->0:01:42.830000
 be in the beautiful Dales countryside and 15 minutes the other way you've got

8
0:01:42.830000-->0:01:47.470000
 all the, you know, the hustle and bustle of the city centre and so the best of

9
0:01:47.470000-->0:01:53.270000
 both worlds and not too far away from Manchester either and because I used to

10
0:01:53.270000-->0:02:06.590000
 have a season ticket at Manchester City so I could still go back. Oh, really? Yeah, my

11
0:02:06.590000-->0:02:11.010000
 granddad took me to watch Manchester City when I was five years old and I'm

12
0:02:11.010000-->0:02:19.670000
 nearly, I'm nearly 54 now and still go, so yeah. It is, it's a, all the, all the

13
0:02:19.670000-->0:02:23.090000
 different generations of my family go, they all sit in the stadium in different

14
0:02:23.090000-->0:02:27.910000
 parts. I've got my sister and my mum and my nephews and nieces and they're,

15
0:02:27.910000-->0:02:37.840000
 they're all, they all sit in the same area. Yeah. Yeah, it is, it's like part of

16
0:02:37.840000-->0:03:04.010000
 your identity isn't it, a sense of belonging and so, do you work? Oh, good

17
0:03:04.010000-->0:03:16.570000
 luck with those then, yeah. And are they based in Manchester? Yeah, I am, I work as a

18
0:03:16.570000-->0:03:22.050000
 counsellor. I used to be the head of the counselling service at the university. I

19
0:03:22.050000-->0:03:26.150000
 left that a few years ago because my health wasn't brilliant and so I just

20
0:03:26.150000-->0:03:31.430000
 work part-time now, privately, from home which works well, gives me a better life

21
0:03:31.430000-->0:03:38.350000
 balance but still, you know, gives me a sense of purpose and value really so I

22
0:03:38.350000-->0:03:48.550000
 like it, it's nice to have. I've got, I'm disabled and it's sort of a chronic sort

23
0:03:48.550000-->0:03:54.030000
 of situation but I think I feel a lot better now I don't have the pressure of

24
0:03:54.030000-->0:03:57.850000
 the full-time job. Oh gosh, that went really quickly, our conversation's over in

25
0:03:57.850000-->0:04:06.070000
 15 seconds. Yeah, and you and hope you do well, you know, get the job that you want

26
0:04:06.070000-->0:04:09.870000
 next week. Alright, have a lovely week.
