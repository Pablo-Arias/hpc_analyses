 Hiya. Hi. How are you doing? This is an awkward situation, isn't it? Really? Well, that's

1
0:00:32.520000-->0:00:37.240000
 what the last woman I spoke to said. She hadn't done the first one either. No, I'm here. I

2
0:00:37.240000-->0:00:48.500000
 want me three quid or whatever it is. So whereabouts are you speaking from? Oh, you're in Devon.

3
0:00:48.500000-->0:00:58.350000
 Oh, God, nice. Yeah, I'm in South London, but sorry. Oh, did you? Yeah, that's not far

4
0:00:58.350000-->0:01:05.290000
 away at all. No, I'm thinking I would like to leave London, but every time I think that

5
0:01:05.290000-->0:01:09.870000
 I think about all the good things about London and all the stuff there is to do. Whereabouts

6
0:01:09.870000-->0:01:28.650000
 in Devon are you? Oh, vaguely, yes. Yeah, yeah, vaguely. Is it nice? Yeah. Do you? Yeah.

7
0:01:28.730000-->0:01:52.410000
 What sort of things do you miss? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know if I'm allowed to say,

8
0:01:52.410000-->0:01:56.850000
 but the last person I spoke to was talking from Wales and she said the same thing. It's

9
0:01:56.850000-->0:02:10.530000
 very quiet here, you know, but I suppose that's why people move there, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.

10
0:02:11.050000-->0:02:21.180000
 How many kids have you got? What sort of ages? So you're busy, aren't you?

11
0:02:24.850000-->0:02:31.500000
 No, I have no children. I've got a very active border collie, so she keeps me going. So I'm

12
0:02:31.500000-->0:02:36.600000
 outside a lot. I'm either out in the garden or I'm out on the local common, walking the dog,

13
0:02:36.600000-->0:02:40.760000
 and I've made friends there. We sit and have coffee, the dogs play. So it's all quite nice.

14
0:02:40.880000-->0:02:46.140000
 It's very much easier than having a five-year-old and an eight-year-old child. It's all very

15
0:02:46.640000-->0:02:57.530000
 relaxed and civilised, actually. So she is hard working away. Yeah, I mean,

16
0:02:57.530000-->0:03:06.510000
 a border collie, she needs her two walks a day, you know, but she's a lovely girl most of the time.

17
0:03:06.510000-->0:03:17.790000
 She's called Billy, but Billy the girl. She wouldn't suit a girly name. She's not a girly

18
0:03:17.790000-->0:03:28.890000
 sort of dog. So how long have you been in Devon then? When did you move down? Oh, right.

19
0:03:39.250000-->0:03:45
 Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Did you move back because you had the kids? Yeah.

20
0:03:48.840000-->0:03:53.780000
 Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a nicer place for them to grow up as well, isn't it?

21
0:03:58.250000-->0:04:04.320000
 Conversation over. Yes, I know. It goes very quick. Yes, thank you.

22
0:04:04.760000-->0:04:07.780000
 Yeah, doesn't it just? It's a funny situation.
