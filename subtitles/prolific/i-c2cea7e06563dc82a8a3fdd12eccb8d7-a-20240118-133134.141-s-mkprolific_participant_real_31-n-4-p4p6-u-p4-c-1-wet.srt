 Hello, sorry, let me come back to you. I've just got a couple of the prolific thing. So

1
0:00:17.700000-->0:00:34.730000
 I was like, I got that on the first one, there was nobody there. So I was like, oh, it was

2
0:00:34.730000-->0:00:40.050000
 just frozen. Yeah, the picture of the girl. So I refreshed it and said nothing happened

3
0:00:40.050000-->0:00:51.500000
 at all. Hopefully not. I'm not too bad. I'm just had a new replacement. So I am at home.

4
0:00:51.980000-->0:00:58.420000
 So I'm five weeks into recovering from that. So that's why I'm this. I've had one done

5
0:00:58.420000-->0:01:05.140000
 before and this one's been a lot less painful than the previous one. So still painful, but

6
0:01:06.180000-->0:01:24.270000
 it's just been motivated to do the exercises and stuff. It's quite hard sometimes. Yeah.

7
0:01:31.890000-->0:01:36.450000
 For me, it's like the bend because you have to get it at a certain degree for it to be

8
0:01:36.450000-->0:01:41.790000
 a success. And I've got it straight, but I'm not quite there on the bend. I think I'm plus

9
0:01:41.790000-->0:01:47.750000
 90, but we'll see. Anyway, we'll get there. Yeah. I just want to go for a walk. I haven't

10
0:01:47.750000-->0:01:51.490000
 been out. I'm not being stuck in the house, obviously, but I've been in my house for about

11
0:01:51.490000-->0:01:57.370000
 two years whilst waiting for this operation. So it's just been like, no, I want to like

12
0:01:57.370000-->0:02:12.420000
 get out. Yeah. Yes. Up north. Yeah. In the Midlands. It's been like this morning it was

13
0:02:12.420000-->0:02:17.780000
 minus seven. We couldn't believe it. It was like flipping ink. So my partner works outside.

14
0:02:17.780000-->0:02:22.380000
 So it's been horrendous for him the last few days. Yeah. It's just like, I've had enough

15
0:02:22.380000-->0:02:41.760000
 of this. Have you got kids? Have you got kids at all? No. I've got three. So two boys and

16
0:02:41.760000-->0:02:49.280000
 a girl. One's 40 this year, one of them is, and then the other one's 35. And then there's

17
0:02:49.280000-->0:02:59.690000
 the baby that's 22 at the moment. He's still at uni. So yeah. Not really, no, because I'm

18
0:02:59.690000-->0:03:24.700000
 divorced. It's, you know, broken families. What can you say? It's not so good. But my

19
0:03:24.700000-->0:03:30.720000
 daughter lives like, she lives in New Mexico, in Santa, America. So I go out there about

20
0:03:30.960000-->0:03:36.340000
 Oh God, I don't know. They were in Vancouver before that. And that is just like amazing.

21
0:03:36.340000-->0:03:42.060000
 If you ever get a chance to go there, but Santa Fe is just, yeah, definitely. It's just Canada

22
0:03:42.060000-->0:03:48.520000
 is amazing. You want to go live there on everything. So clean the buses run on time.

23
0:03:48.520000-->0:03:53.860000
 I mean, okay. I know. Yeah. You know, if you want, if you have, if you need public transport,

24
0:03:53.860000-->0:03:58.740000
 it's there. Not like here, where all the conversation's over in 15 seconds. Sorry.

25
0:04:00.320000-->0:04:08.070000
 Hadn't you, sweetheart? Thank you very much, sweetie. Take care.
