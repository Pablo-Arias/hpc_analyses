0
0:00:07.650000-->0:00:24.420000
 I'm okay, thanks. How are you? Oh, I can hear so much better. Yeah, I had someone on before

1
0:00:24.420000-->0:00:28.180000
 and there was like major technical difficulties. I couldn't hear a word she was saying, bless

2
0:00:28.480000-->0:00:38.580000
 her. And then she froze completely. I know. I did message the people who put the survey

3
0:00:38.580000-->0:00:42.800000
 out and said to them and they were just like, oh, just persist. And the next minute it said

4
0:00:42.800000-->0:00:50.140000
 you only got 15 seconds left to talk. We literally spoke about nothing. Where are you from? You're

5
0:00:50.140000-->0:01:07.720000
 from where? Ah, right, okay. No way. I'm from Glasgow. No, I don't think so. That's just

6
0:01:07.720000-->0:01:18.250000
 total coincidence. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it's the same. It's so cold. It was like minus

7
0:01:18.250000-->0:01:23.290000
 six when I got up this morning. So yeah, it's not giving us much choice but to actually

8
0:01:23.290000-->0:01:37.050000
 put the heating on, isn't it not? Which is a pain, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have you got

9
0:01:37.050000-->0:01:46.720000
 kids? No kids, just yourself. Oh, right. Okay. Yeah, I've got a wee girl. Yeah. So I try

10
0:01:46.720000-->0:01:50.780000
 and have the heating on in the morning for when she gets up so that she's warm. But when

11
0:01:50.780000-->0:01:54.400000
 it's just me, it's like, I don't need the heating. It's fine. I can have a hot, I've

12
0:01:54.400000-->0:02:06.410000
 got a hot water bottle. So yeah. I know. She's, she's 11. She's 11. So this is her last year

13
0:02:06.410000-->0:02:11.370000
 in primary school. So it is. So, and then she goes on to secondary school, which I'm

14
0:02:11.370000-->0:02:19.450000
 not prepared for. She's more than ready. Yeah, she's more than ready, I'm not. Oh, yeah,

15
0:02:23.260000-->0:02:35.240000
 absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Is that your sister's daughter or your brother? Sisters? Yeah. Oh,

16
0:02:35.240000-->0:02:54.080000
 wow. I bet she tells you about the attitude as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I have

17
0:02:54.080000-->0:02:59.940000
 nephews. My sister has two boys. And my brother has two boys. So my daughter is the only girl.

18
0:02:59.940000-->0:03:05.980000
 And honestly, when I say girls are the most difficult, they really are. Like really,

19
0:03:06-->0:03:25.750000
 the attitude is wow. The sass. Yeah. Oh, it's so true. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Definitely.

20
0:03:25.750000-->0:03:30.930000
 I know sometimes she wants to hang about with women. Sometimes she's like, no, you're such a

21
0:03:30.930000-->0:03:40.650000
 girl, get out of my room. I'm like, all right, okay. So yeah. No, definitely not. No, no. It's

22
0:03:40.650000-->0:03:45.510000
 like her school's not far from us. So when I look out the window, I can see into the playground and

23
0:03:45.510000-->0:03:51.230000
 she'll go, get away from the window in case my friends see you. And I'm like, I think I'm all

24
0:03:51.230000-->0:04:00.120000
 right. But okay then, yeah. They're going to see you. So yeah, I know. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So

25
0:04:00.120000-->0:04:08.870000
 fun times. I know. I know. You too. No, definitely. I know. They don't give you long for this, do they?
