0
0:00:05.120000-->0:00:06.440000
 Jamie, can you shut the kitchen door?

1
0:00:08.740000-->0:00:10.580000
 I can't, there's somebody talking to me.

2
0:00:10.580000-->0:00:10.920000
 Hello?

3
0:00:10.920000-->0:00:11.600000
 Hello.

4
0:00:14.910000-->0:00:15.510000
 How are you?

5
0:00:15.510000-->0:00:17.850000
 Okay, thanks.

6
0:00:17.850000-->0:00:21.560000
 Can you hear me okay?

7
0:00:24.750000-->0:00:25.170000
 Yes.

8
0:00:25.170000-->0:00:28.190000
 Because I had problems with two of the other calls.

9
0:00:28.190000-->0:00:29.850000
 We couldn't hear each other.

10
0:00:32.480000-->0:00:32.640000
 Oh.

11
0:00:36.970000-->0:00:36.990000
 Yeah?

12
0:00:38.250000-->0:00:39.820000
 Oh, yeah, okay.

13
0:00:39.820000-->0:00:44.260000
 And one of them was really bad, like a loud noise in the background.

14
0:00:44.260000-->0:00:45.500000
 It was really loud.

15
0:00:45.700000-->0:00:47.020000
 I don't know.

16
0:00:56.050000-->0:00:59.710000
 I wonder if it might be, like, deliberate as part of the test, maybe.

17
0:01:01.850000-->0:01:03.110000
 You think?

18
0:01:03.850000-->0:01:04.470000
 Yeah.

19
0:01:05.350000-->0:01:06.650000
 Or what you're supposed to do?

20
0:01:06.850000-->0:01:07.610000
 I don't know.

21
0:01:08.850000-->0:01:11.250000
 So, where do you live?

22
0:01:11.250000-->0:01:12.050000
 Where are you from?

23
0:01:16.050000-->0:01:16.590000
 Oh, yeah.

24
0:01:17.050000-->0:01:18.530000
 Near Liverpool?

25
0:01:20.050000-->0:01:20.690000
 Yeah.

26
0:01:25-->0:01:29.660000
 Yeah, I don't work, so the weekend's not really, yeah.

27
0:01:30-->0:01:32.160000
 It's not really that different for me.

28
0:01:36.400000-->0:01:44.430000
 I might go in the garden and do some gardening, if the weather's okay.

29
0:01:44.450000-->0:01:45.450000
 Yeah?

30
0:01:50.500000-->0:01:51.760000
 Yeah.

31
0:01:52.500000-->0:01:54.700000
 I know, I can't wait, though, really.

32
0:01:54.700000-->0:01:56.900000
 Just can't wait for spring, and, yeah.

33
0:02:01.910000-->0:02:02.290000
 Yeah?

34
0:02:05.790000-->0:02:06.410000
 Oh, yeah.

35
0:02:06.410000-->0:02:07.150000
 Yeah.

36
0:02:08.510000-->0:02:09.690000
 Do you like gardening, then?

37
0:02:09.690000-->0:02:09.890000
 Yeah.

38
0:02:09.950000-->0:02:14.170000
 No, I'm not.

39
0:02:14.170000-->0:02:14.810000
 I'm not.

40
0:02:24.830000-->0:02:24.850000
 Oh.

41
0:02:25.830000-->0:02:25.850000
 Yeah.

42
0:02:29.750000-->0:02:30.130000
 All right.

43
0:02:30.130000-->0:02:30.330000
 Yeah.

44
0:02:31.820000-->0:02:32.160000
 Oh.

45
0:02:32.160000-->0:02:32.720000
 Yeah.

46
0:02:32.900000-->0:02:38.290000
 Yeah.

47
0:02:39.350000-->0:02:40.170000
 All right.

48
0:02:40.170000-->0:02:45.350000
 Mine's, like, south-west facing, and it gets a lot of smoke, yeah.

49
0:02:45.350000-->0:02:51.350000
 But I like gardening, but I haven't got a clue, and I'm just, like, learning, really.

50
0:02:51.350000-->0:02:54.450000
 I'm making a lot of mistakes, and, like, I don't really know what I'm doing.

51
0:02:54.950000-->0:02:55.890000
 So, yeah.

52
0:02:58.740000-->0:02:59.620000
 Not really.

53
0:02:59.620000-->0:03:06.780000
 It's just, like, it's, like, the soil's not very good, and, like, it's hard to dig.

54
0:03:06.780000-->0:03:10.620000
 The soil's, like, very, like, clay, and there's a lot of stones and, like, bricks,

55
0:03:10.620000-->0:03:15.700000
 so, like, it's hard work to dig it, and, like, I want to, like, put, you know.

56
0:03:16.800000-->0:03:16.820000
 Yeah.

57
0:03:16.820000-->0:03:17.160000
 Yeah.

58
0:03:17.160000-->0:03:21.350000
 Yeah.

59
0:03:21.750000-->0:03:24.940000
 I know, and it's, I know.

60
0:03:24.940000-->0:03:28.560000
 I want to, like, put a border in, you know, to put some more plants in,

61
0:03:28.560000-->0:03:30.240000
 because it's hard to dig.

62
0:03:31.200000-->0:03:34.620000
 It's just, like, hard, so, yeah.

63
0:03:38.880000-->0:03:39.840000
 Oh, yeah.

64
0:03:39.840000-->0:03:40.040000
 Yeah.

65
0:03:41.700000-->0:03:43.420000
 My back, I know, yeah.

66
0:03:43.700000-->0:03:45.700000
 I've got, like, a spade.

67
0:03:45.700000-->0:03:51.660000
 I was going to get, like, a border spade, you know, with a curved edge to dig a border.

68
0:03:51.700000-->0:03:52.520000
 Yeah.

69
0:03:52.700000-->0:03:54.800000
 I don't know if I need one, but I was going to buy one.

70
0:03:55.700000-->0:03:57.880000
 But it's nice talking to you anyway.

71
0:04:02.130000-->0:04:02.150000
 Okay.

72
0:04:02.150000-->0:04:02.570000
 Okay.

 Yeah.

76

 Okay.

77
0:04:08.100000-->0:04:08.480000
 Oh, yeah.
