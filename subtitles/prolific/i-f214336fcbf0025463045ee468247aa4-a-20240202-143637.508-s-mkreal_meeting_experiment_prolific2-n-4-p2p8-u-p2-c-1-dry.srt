 Hello. Hi, Chris. I'm Edwina. Hello. How are you? Oh, whereabouts? Oh, right, right.

1
0:00:28.630000-->0:00:37.040000
 So not too cold yet then, I suppose. Is it? Yes, yeah. I'm in Wilmslow in Cheshire.

2
0:00:39.150000-->0:01:06.130000
 How did you? Twelve miles? Yes, yeah. Oh, lovely, lovely. And I worked in Glasgow, the

3
0:01:06.130000-->0:01:12.350000
 city centre, just doing some consultancy work for a few months, about five years ago.

4
0:01:12.710000-->0:01:31.780000
 So yes, I know Glasgow a little bit, but just the centre. Lovely people. Oh, very much so.

5
0:01:31.780000-->0:01:37.780000
 I did, I did. And it seems like a lot of money's been spent on the city as well.

6
0:02:08.800000-->0:02:17.450000
 It's lovely. It's because we're near the Peak District, it's quite damp most of the time and it's,

7
0:02:17.690000-->0:02:24.050000
 you know, it rains a lot. But apart from that, it's just a lovely place to live.

8
0:02:24.050000-->0:02:30.490000
 I can walk to all the coffee shops and, you know, everything that I need, which for me health-wise,

9
0:02:30.490000-->0:02:36.810000
 I've just come out of hospital. So it's nice to have everything on my doorstep because I can't drive at the moment.

10
0:02:36.810000-->0:02:43.630000
 So, so I'm just doing a little bit of walking every day and, you know, taking each day as it comes.

11
0:02:43.630000-->0:02:51.050000
 But yeah, so, so I like being near, near to everywhere. But yeah, I can't complain.

12
0:02:54.750000-->0:03:02.190000
 Thank you. Thank you. Before I had the surgery, I thought, right, mind over matter.

13
0:03:02.190000-->0:03:07.270000
 I'm a positive person. I'll, you know, I'll recover really quickly.

14
0:03:07.270000-->0:03:14.150000
 And of course, when there's, you know, like a lot of surgery involved and a lot of anaesthetic,

15
0:03:14.150000-->0:03:19.230000
 it doesn't work out the way your mind wants to, you know, unfortunately.

16
0:03:19.230000-->0:03:26.110000
 So I'm sort of battling with that sort of frustration that I can't, you know,

17
0:03:26.110000-->0:03:30.930000
 I can't make myself better quicker than nature wants me to.

18
0:03:30.930000-->0:03:34.690000
 But I'll get there. You know, it'll just take a little bit of time.

19
0:03:34.690000-->0:03:40.450000
 And I'm well looked after by, you know, the good thing about being around Manchester is, you know,

20
0:03:40.450000-->0:03:46.090000
 the, the, the, the trust, you know, the NHS trusts are just fabulous.

21
0:03:46.090000-->0:03:52.730000
 You know, they really embrace you when, when you have, you know, when you're not well.

22
0:03:52.730000-->0:03:57.050000
 So I can't complain at that. Well, it looks like our time's up.

23
0:04:02.650000-->0:04:08.460000
 Oh, thank you so much. It's been lovely meeting you too. Bye bye.
