 Hello, I'm good. Thanks. How are you doing? Yeah, so far I've seen two people. I am based

1
0:00:33.650000-->0:00:45.770000
 in London, but I'm originally from Russia. I've I've heard this is this is not the first

2
0:00:45.770000-->0:00:54.230000
 time I'm hearing this. It seems like everyone's a bit up north on this call. Yeah, I know

3
0:00:54.230000-->0:00:59.650000
 we were just talking about it that it's like it snowed in London a couple of weeks ago.

4
0:00:59.950000-->0:01:06.030000
 And it was like for about three seconds of snow. But then you go on Instagram. It's like,

5
0:01:06.030000-->0:01:12.610000
 oh my god, it was snowing in London and everyone's just filming it. And I'm like, you know, I've

6
0:01:12.610000-->0:01:18.130000
 had many, many decades of snow like screw that. You know, I'm not filming that snow.

7
0:01:30.090000-->0:01:36.010000
 It's I feel like it's in our blood basically to be ice skating. I went I haven't been for

8
0:01:36.010000-->0:01:42.130000
 a very long time. So like, I think I last went when I was 14 or 15. And I went this

9
0:01:42.130000-->0:01:47.570000
 winter with my friends. And you know, I just I just stood on it. And I and I just went

10
0:01:47.570000-->0:01:51.750000
 for it. And I was like, you know, I haven't I've been out of practice for about 15 years.

11
0:01:51.750000-->0:01:55.930000
 How is it possible that I still know how to do it? And it's like, it's in your blood.

12
0:01:56.110000-->0:02:11.290000
 You know, you it just came back to me. We basically did. Well, there are like the cool

13
0:02:11.290000-->0:02:15.670000
 organized ones. So I'm from Moscow. So we have one that's on the Red Square. So they

14
0:02:15.670000-->0:02:20.610000
 basically pour it all over the Red Square. And it's beautiful. Never been there. But

15
0:02:20.610000-->0:02:25.350000
 there's a lot of like really random ones. So there's always like a little football field

16
0:02:25.350000-->0:02:31.370000
 for kids to play around like in different areas around town. And essentially, in the

17
0:02:31.370000-->0:02:34.690000
 winter, they just pour water all over it, because you don't really need to maintain

18
0:02:34.690000-->0:02:39.370000
 it or anything, you know, because it's just cold. You just pour water and it stays there.

19
0:02:39.370000-->0:02:45.090000
 Whereas again, in London, you know, you pay, I think we paid what, like 25 pounds to go

20
0:02:45.090000-->0:02:50.650000
 for 40 minutes, probably just because you know, it takes them so much money to actually

21
0:02:50.650000-->0:03:05.420000
 maintain it when it's plus 10 degrees outside. How do you even keep the ice being icy? Exactly.

22
0:03:05.420000-->0:03:09.860000
 And the fact that you need to pay 25 pounds to go ice skating, I'm like, well, go to Russia,

23
0:03:09.860000-->0:03:15.360000
 it's all free, you just go, you know. So you go outside and that's all ice skating.

24
0:03:33.030000-->0:04:06.200000
 How did you How did you feel about the minus 12? Nice to Nice to meet you as well. Bye.
