0:00:10.850000-->0:00:17.250000
 Hiya! Have you had one of your... My name's Raina, what's yours?

1
0:00:18.200000-->0:00:21.600000
 Oh hi Martha, whereabouts are you located?

2
0:00:21.600000-->0:00:33.320000
 Oh hi, okay, that's not too far from me. I'm in Bedfordshire, so I think you're like maybe an hour's drive further on the A1M, so yeah.

3
0:00:35.100000-->0:00:38.470000
 It's cold today, isn't it? I've been freezing all day.

4
0:00:39.500000-->0:00:48.490000
 I've got a blanket over me, but yeah, it's going to get worse as well apparently.

5
0:00:48.490000-->0:00:57.530000
 In Northern Ireland, my job means that I kind of work from the UK, but I also work in Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland,

6
0:00:57.530000-->0:01:01.590000
 and they've got like a national emergency there today with the snow.

7
0:01:01.590000-->0:01:04.490000
 Like everything's closed down, there's no transport in and out.

8
0:01:04.490000-->0:01:05.930000
 I was like, oh God, that's coming our way.

9
0:01:05.930000-->0:01:08.210000
 Yeah, that's crazy.

10
0:01:20.500000-->0:01:22.540000
 Like Bambi on ice.

11
0:01:27.300000-->0:01:29.940000
 Oh, brilliant. Yeah, me too.

12
0:01:29.940000-->0:01:37.620000
 So I work for a retail company, so we basically like, we've got shops all over,

13
0:01:37.620000-->0:01:45.080000
 but I kind of, it's weird because I'm based in the UK and probably say like 90% of my job is in the Republic of Ireland.

14
0:01:45.080000-->0:01:49.880000
 So yeah, 10% sort of in Northern Ireland and then the rest of it's in Republic of Ireland.

15
0:01:49.880000-->0:01:55.080000
 So it's quite good because I get to go over probably every quarter, which is quite nice.

16
0:01:55.080000-->0:01:58.140000
 So yeah. What is it that you do?

17
0:02:10.480000-->0:02:11.920000
 Oh, it goes straight over my head.

18
0:02:11.920000-->0:02:24.430000
 I can imagine.

19
0:02:29.700000-->0:02:34.050000
 And I like the fact that you can withdraw it straight away as well. That helps, doesn't it?

20
0:02:34.050000-->0:02:39.050000
 Like if you need petrol or something, you're like, oh, OK, quick, go and withdraw some of my balance.

21
0:02:39.050000-->0:02:46.190000
 But your job must be tough in the current climate, right? Because the prices, I presume, are going up and down.

22
0:02:55.850000-->0:03:14.430000
 Yeah. And with all the wars and stuff, does that impact it as well?

23
0:03:16.250000-->0:03:41.020000
 Yeah. Yeah.

24
0:03:44.410000-->0:03:44.830000
 Oh, no.

25
0:03:56.080000-->0:03:56.500000
 Oh, no.

26
0:03:56.500000-->0:03:59.740000
 You need stability in the world.

27
0:04:05.820000-->0:04:06.780000
 Yes, me too.

28
0:04:09.580000-->0:04:09.740000
 Yep.
