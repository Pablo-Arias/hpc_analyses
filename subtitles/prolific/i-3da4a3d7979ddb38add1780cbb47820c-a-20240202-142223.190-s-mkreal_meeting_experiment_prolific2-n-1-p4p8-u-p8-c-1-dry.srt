 Hi. Can you hear me all right?

1
0:00:15.500000-->0:00:17.940000
 Yes, I can hear you.

2
0:00:24.500000-->0:00:30.740000
 Yes, I don't see myself, but I see you, and I can see you clearly.

3
0:00:42.450000-->0:00:48.590000
 And we have Miss Lina, right?

4
0:00:49.940000-->0:00:52
 Oh, Jasmina, I understand.

5
0:00:52.600000-->0:00:57.240000
 Well, I'm Chris. I'm Chris, and I'm from Scotland.

6
0:00:57.600000-->0:01:10.340000
 Oh, ah, I don't know London well, but I have been to London.

7
0:01:10.340000-->0:01:15.740000
 My grandmother lived in London when I was a child.

8
0:01:22.240000-->0:01:25.680000
 Oh, many years ago, Jasmina.

9
0:01:25.800000-->0:01:31.840000
 Uh, maybe even more than 30 years ago.

10
0:01:31.840000-->0:01:46.060000
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

11
0:02:00.310000-->0:02:03.970000
 Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed Scotland.

12
0:02:03.970000-->0:02:06.290000
 Are you married, Jasmina?

13
0:02:13.510000-->0:02:17.170000
 I'm not married. I've never been married.

14
0:02:17.170000-->0:02:24.690000
 But I have a lovely family living locally in Scotland,

15
0:02:24.690000-->0:02:38.830000
 including a great-great-nephew, a little baby boy, now almost 20 months.

16
0:02:38.830000-->0:02:45.970000
 We have a close family, although I have never been married, and I have no children.

17
0:02:45.970000-->0:02:46.990000
 What about you?

18
0:03:02.950000-->0:03:22.160000
 Ah, and is your husband from Macedonia?

19
0:03:26.040000-->0:03:26.940000
 Poland?

20
0:03:37.260000-->0:03:37.540000
 Ah.

21
0:03:38-->0:03:42.860000
 Have you visited Poland many times?

22
0:03:50.950000-->0:03:51.760000
 Ah.

23
0:04:04.700000-->0:04:07.260000
 May I ask you a story?
