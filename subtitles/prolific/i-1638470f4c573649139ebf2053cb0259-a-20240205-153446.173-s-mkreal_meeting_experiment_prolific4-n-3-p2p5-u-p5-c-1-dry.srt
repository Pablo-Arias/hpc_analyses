 Hello. How are you?

1
0:00:21.870000-->0:00:26.280000
 Sorry? Nice to see you.

2
0:00:26.280000-->0:00:28.060000
 What's your name?

3
0:00:30.050000-->0:00:32.510000
 My name is Yagoda.

4
0:00:32.510000-->0:00:34.670000
 You are in the UK, yes?

5
0:00:34.670000-->0:00:41.960000
 Well, I think all the rest of the participants were in the UK,

6
0:00:41.960000-->0:00:44.700000
 so I was thinking, yeah, it's just UK participants.

7
0:00:44.700000-->0:00:45.580000
 Yeah.

8
0:00:47.450000-->0:00:49.390000
 No, I wouldn't be able to, no.

9
0:00:53.800000-->0:00:56.660000
 No, no, no. I'm from Macedonia.

10
0:01:04.650000-->0:01:09.470000
 Oh, okay.

11
0:01:11.260000-->0:01:13.300000
 And you are from Italy, or?

12
0:01:22.540000-->0:01:25.040000
 Okay, okay, because you asked me if I'm from Italy.

13
0:01:25.040000-->0:01:26.860000
 Maybe you recognize something.

14
0:01:42.670000-->0:01:45.770000
 Like a European, yeah, European accent.

15
0:01:46.350000-->0:01:46.770000
 Okay.

16
0:01:52.650000-->0:01:58.190000
 It's been nice. I've been about almost three years now on Freelifex.

17
0:02:19.060000-->0:02:19.220000
 Yeah.

18
0:02:19.220000-->0:02:20.120000
 Yeah, yeah.

19
0:02:35.550000-->0:02:37.710000
 Yes, I do like it.

20
0:02:37.710000-->0:02:45.350000
 But what I did in the last period is, because there were really small payments, like 0.15, 0.25,

21
0:02:45.550000-->0:02:49.110000
 and you're even risking to be rejected for a study.

22
0:02:49.550000-->0:02:53.570000
 And then you need to write with researchers.

23
0:02:53.570000-->0:03:00.810000
 So I just decided to do only the ones that are paying more than one pound, 1.50.

24
0:03:00.810000-->0:03:03.330000
 And I think that works much better.

25
0:03:03.330000-->0:03:05.810000
 Yeah, it works much better with less work.

26
0:03:05.810000-->0:03:09.610000
 I'm actually getting exactly the same amount of money,

27
0:03:09.610000-->0:03:15.890000
 because I'm just saying, clicking not interested on the ones that are not paying well.

28
0:03:15.890000-->0:03:22.330000
 So I think algorithm wants to catch up to, because there is algorithm, isn't it?

29
0:03:22.330000-->0:03:24.850000
 You know, with client.

30
0:03:24.850000-->0:03:30.810000
 So I decided to do that way because really it was frustrating.

31
0:03:30.810000-->0:03:34.950000
 Sometimes there will be a problem just for 0.15.

32
0:03:34.950000-->0:03:39.030000
 And yes, you will have problem, but it will not open or whatever.

33
0:03:39.030000-->0:03:44.030000
 And I'm like, I don't want to bother really, because I also do other platforms.

34
0:03:44.030000-->0:03:51.630000
 And the payment on Prolific, it's actually not as good as on other platforms.

35
0:03:51.630000-->0:04:05.150000
 So it is like user testing, you know, it's different than Prolific.

36
0:04:05.750000-->0:04:09.470000
 But it's not like typing.
