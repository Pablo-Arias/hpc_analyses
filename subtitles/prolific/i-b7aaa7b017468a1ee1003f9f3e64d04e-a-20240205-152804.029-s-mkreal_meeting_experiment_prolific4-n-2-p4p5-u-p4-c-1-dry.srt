 I'm Joanne. I'm fine, thank you. How are you? Good. Yes, I don't mind spending time talking.

1
0:00:32.120000-->0:00:42.090000
 Yes. So what's your weather like? I'm on the south coast in Hampshire, right on the coast.

2
0:00:42.090000-->0:00:54.330000
 Yes. What about? Oh, okay, yes. I know where that is. It's drizzling today, not so good.

3
0:00:54.330000-->0:01:03.080000
 No. Your football team are playing tonight, Brentford. They're playing, yeah, Manchester City.

4
0:01:03.080000-->0:01:19.680000
 They're playing the big team Manchester City today. I do. Yes. So what other? I'm Joanne.

5
0:01:19.680000-->0:01:38.120000
 Oh, where's that from? Oh, Macedonia. Yes. I know roughly where it is. Yes. It's only a very small place, though.

6
0:01:44.450000-->0:02:15.860000
 No. Okay. Yes. Oh, lovely. So what did you study? Oh, yes. Good. And you like living?

7
0:02:16.950000-->0:02:25.050000
 I'm retired pretty much now, but I am too studying at the moment. I was made redundant.

8
0:02:25.050000-->0:02:34.050000
 So it was a choice of looking for another job, going into retirement fully or doing a bit of studying.

9
0:02:34.050000-->0:02:57.710000
 So I'm doing that at the moment. I hope so. Yes. Yes. Good. No, it's very nice.

10
0:02:58.650000-->0:03:07.300000
 Yes. But a lot of people do live here now because it's popular to live in the south.

11
0:03:07.300000-->0:03:26.280000
 So it's quite built up. Yes. I'm just thinking it's about exactly a year I've been with Prolific.

12
0:03:26.880000-->0:03:32.800000
 Yes. And I'm enjoying it very much because I get some quite interesting studies.

13
0:03:33.500000-->0:03:40.540000
 All the psychology students seem to have projects. And so you get some quite interesting studies.

14
0:03:46.450000-->0:04:07.920000
 So do you work? Have you got a job? Yes. No.
