 Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Lea.

1
0:00:21.650000-->0:00:26.170000
 Sorry, this is such a surreal study to take part in. Have you ever done anything like this before?

2
0:00:36.730000-->0:00:37.010000
 Yeah.

3
0:00:39.700000-->0:00:40.540000
 I know.

4
0:00:41.840000-->0:00:43.040000
 I know, I know.

5
0:00:43.100000-->0:00:50.780000
 Yeah, I've been on the platform probably for about... I'm so sorry, I know you asked a question, but I was just like, oh, this is so strange.

6
0:00:51.700000-->0:00:57.300000
 Yeah, I've been on Prolific for about three years now, so a fairly long time.

7
0:00:57.700000-->0:01:08.540000
 But no, I've never done anything like this before. Like you say, I've done video calls where you've had a topic or you've had a task to complete and you have to interact with the person.

8
0:01:08.540000-->0:01:13.120000
 They've got some information, you've got some information, but yeah, nothing like this, nothing like this.

9
0:01:13.120000-->0:01:25.360000
 But yeah, validate. Exactly.

10
0:01:33.680000-->0:01:34
 Yeah.

11
0:01:34-->0:01:44.300000
 No, I know. I was thinking maybe it's to do with, obviously, Verizon Video, calling and remote working and building relationships.

12
0:01:44.300000-->0:01:46.620000
 But I don't know. I don't know.

13
0:01:46.620000-->0:01:47.520000
 But no.

14
0:01:49-->0:01:53.960000
 I do want to ask you a question. At the weekend, it looks nice weather, so probably going out for a walk. What about you?

15
0:01:59.410000-->0:01:59.910000
 Lovely.

16
0:02:07.920000-->0:02:09.340000
 I know. Do you work full time?

17
0:02:10.970000-->0:02:11.390000
 Yeah.

18
0:02:11.390000-->0:02:18.530000
 Yeah, full time as well. I mean, it's nice that I can dip in and out and do things like this, but yeah.

19
0:02:22.640000-->0:02:22.960000
 Yeah.

20
0:02:25.850000-->0:02:34.250000
 Oh, I know. And then I think it's quite nice because everyone kind of goes, it's an unwritten rule, isn't there, about Friday afternoons where you're like, just don't bother me.

21
0:02:34.250000-->0:02:40.510000
 I just need to get stuff done before we all sign off the week. Please leave me alone, which is actually quite nice. Yeah.

22
0:02:40.510000-->0:02:41.530000
 So what about you?

23
0:02:46.640000-->0:02:50.080000
 Oh, lovely. So I'm the other side in Suffolk.

24
0:02:50.400000-->0:02:59.570000
 Yeah, yeah. So I used to live in Gloucestershire and then we moved over to East Anglia in the pandemic, which is quite nice.

25
0:02:59.570000-->0:03:05.530000
 But yeah, it's really nice here. I would say lovely weather, even though it's a bit cold at the minute.

26
0:03:08.550000-->0:03:12.330000
 Is this your fourth conversation that you've been having?

27
0:03:12.550000-->0:03:21.510000
 I think so. I think it's my last one as well, which is, yeah, as I said, this is the only one.

28
0:03:26.200000-->0:03:34.230000
 Oh, maybe. So I've spoken to a lady originally from Canada.

29
0:03:36.810000-->0:03:36.930000
 No.

30
0:03:38.350000-->0:03:42.750000
 OK. Maybe. Yeah.

31
0:03:45.630000-->0:03:45.650000
 No.

32
0:03:45.650000-->0:03:46.010000
 No.

33
0:03:50.700000-->0:04:00.030000
 Oh, that's really interesting. I've only had females, so no guys. So that's really interesting.

34
0:04:00.650000-->0:04:08.620000
 Oh, I know. That's flown by. And you. Enjoy. And I hope you get your admin all caught up with. Lovely.
