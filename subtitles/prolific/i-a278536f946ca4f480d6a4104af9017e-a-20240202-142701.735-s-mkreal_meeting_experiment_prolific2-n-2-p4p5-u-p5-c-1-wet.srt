 Hi there, I'm good thank you. How are you today? I'm Sue. Sue, where are you based?

1
0:00:36.530000-->0:00:45.360000
 I'm in Leeds at the moment in the UK. Do you know Leeds at all? Do you know where

2
0:00:45.360000-->0:01:02.950000
 Leeds is in the north of England? All right, all right, yes. And what do you do in

3
0:01:02.950000-->0:01:40.530000
 London, Yasmeen? What do you do in London? What job do you do? Ah, right. I'm a

4
0:01:40.530000-->0:01:48.660000
 counsellor. Yes, I used to be the head of the counselling service at the

5
0:01:48.660000-->0:01:54.560000
 University but I left that role about five, six years ago to get better life

6
0:01:54.560000-->0:01:59.960000
 balance and I just work remotely from home now and I do supervision of other

7
0:01:59.960000-->0:02:06.840000
 counsellors and a bit of consultancy work for organisations but yeah, it's

8
0:02:06.840000-->0:02:23.150000
 fulfilling work, isn't it? I think it has advantages and disadvantages. I think

9
0:02:23.150000-->0:02:29.530000
 that you do lose a little bit of the therapeutic relationship, don't you, with

10
0:02:29.530000-->0:02:34.630000
 not having a presence but on the other hand it makes it a lot more accessible

11
0:02:34.630000-->0:02:42.070000
 for a lot of people, doesn't it? And I'm disabled so it's a lot easier for me,

12
0:02:42.070000-->0:02:47.990000
 you know, being able to work from home as well. So yeah, advantages and

13
0:02:47.990000-->0:03:24.280000
 disadvantages really. What about yourself? How do you find it? Yeah, scary. We have a

14
0:03:24.280000-->0:03:40.410000
 lot in common. Yeah, I use crutches all the time and a wheelchair when I have to

15
0:03:40.410000-->0:03:52.980000
 go further than, you know, a few hundred metres sort of thing so yeah. Yeah, I had

16
0:03:52.980000-->0:04:02.720000
 surgery that went wrong about 25 years ago and it's left me with CRPS so yeah

17
0:04:02.720000-->0:04:08.260000
 but, you know, we get on with it, don't we? We just get on with it.
