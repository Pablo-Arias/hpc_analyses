0:00:08.150000-->0:00:23.910000
 Oh, hi. How are you? Good, I'm not bad. Where are you from? Oh, lovely. I'd like to go to

1
0:00:23.910000-->0:00:34.920000
 Brighton actually. Yeah. What's the weather like? Cold. Yeah. Yeah, it's the same, it's

2
0:00:34.920000-->0:00:39.880000
 cold but the sun's came out so it's kind of heating up slightly. So it was like minus

3
0:00:39.880000-->0:00:46.600000
 six when we woke up this morning. So yeah, but the sun is helping a lot. So that's good.

4
0:00:46.980000-->0:00:55.250000
 Yeah. Yeah. Try not to put the heating on as well as much. That's, bells are through

5
0:00:55.250000-->0:01:04.760000
 the roof, aren't they? It's ridiculous. So, I know. I know. I know that's it because you're

6
0:01:04.760000-->0:01:07.380000
 stuck, aren't you? Because you're like, I need to do a washing, I need to put the heating

7
0:01:07.380000-->0:01:13.420000
 on to dry it or it's just going to stink of dampness. I know. Yeah, definitely. Uh-huh.

8
0:01:13.420000-->0:01:20.430000
 Okay, that's good. No, so we're, you're like the fourth person I've spoke to I think? Yeah.

9
0:01:23.700000-->0:01:30.770000
 Right. Oh, is it right? Okay. The first person that I had on, I couldn't hear like a word

10
0:01:30.770000-->0:01:35.130000
 she was saying. So I don't know if it was something to do with, I don't think it was

11
0:01:35.130000-->0:01:39.370000
 to do with my mic because everyone else I've been able to hear, but I couldn't hear a word

12
0:01:39.370000-->0:01:43.330000
 and I felt really bad. But she, and then next minute she completely froze and I was like,

13
0:01:43.690000-->0:01:51.650000
 okay. I know. She seemed really sweet as well. So that was a shame. But yeah. Yeah. So do you work?

14
0:01:53.700000-->0:02:04.240000
 Do you, are you, do you work? Are you off today? Oh, brilliant. Wow. What on?

15
0:02:07.600000-->0:02:16.270000
 Wow. Oh, that's fantastic. Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. If you could give me any advice for

16
0:02:16.270000-->0:02:19.190000
 an 11 year old with an attitude, it would be more than helpful.

17
0:02:25.380000-->0:02:30.700000
 I don't know. So she's a, yeah, she was just talking actually that like a couple of girls

18
0:02:30.700000-->0:02:34.680000
 before and she was, she didn't have any kids, but she was saying she was like, oh yeah,

19
0:02:34.680000-->0:02:38.880000
 she's like, I've got nieces and they're like, attitude is so different to my nephews.

20
0:02:38.900000-->0:02:45.420000
 And I'm like, yeah, that's yeah, definitely. So how long have you been doing that then?

21
0:02:50.100000-->0:02:58.770000
 Right. Oh, brilliant. Right. Okay. Oh, that's good. Oh, that's really good. So

22
0:02:59.530000-->0:03:05.050000

23
0:03:14.700000-->0:03:22.670000
 Yeah. Yeah. My cousin is a teacher and from what I hear it is not easy. It's not easy going at all.

24
0:03:22.670000-->0:03:30.870000
 So yeah, I can imagine. Yeah. She has quite a lot of issues as well. So, um, yeah. And she's

25
0:03:30.870000-->0:03:35.610000
 always tired and that's, that's the thing. She's, she's like, I don't, she's like my hours aren't

26
0:03:35.610000-->0:03:41.010000
 school hours. Like she's coming home at night and marking and she's like, people don't see that.

27
0:03:41.010000-->0:03:45.130000
 She says I'm sometime in the building at like seven in the morning, you know? And I'm like,

28
0:03:45.130000-->0:03:55.190000
