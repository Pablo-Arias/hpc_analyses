0:00:20.600000-->0:00:37.240000
 No, neither could I, funnily enough. It was a terrible connection. Are you okay? No, I

1
0:00:37.240000-->0:00:45.370000
 don't know. I think we're participants. I think we have to, yeah, for just, I think

2
0:00:45.370000-->0:00:49.750000
 they want to see how new people get on when meeting. We have to talk for four minutes

3
0:00:49.750000-->0:01:00.100000
 and then literally it just goes dead. That's a good way to put it. I'm based in Essex in

4
0:01:00.100000-->0:01:16.830000
 the UK. Oh, oh my God. We have rain. Not snow yet, but we have rain, bad rain today. I know,

5
0:01:16.830000-->0:01:27.950000
 definitely. I'm so ready for it now. I'm fed up with big jumpers. Yeah, definitely. It

6
0:01:27.950000-->0:01:37.170000
 was light here. Sorry, my cat. Yeah, yesterday I came home. I got home about half five yesterday

7
0:01:37.170000-->0:01:52.320000
 and it was still light. So that was really nice. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's

8
0:01:52.320000-->0:02:08.830000
 good. What are you up to today then? Anything exciting? It's as exciting as my life. I've

9
0:02:08.830000-->0:02:17.370000
 got someone coming to fix my tumble dryer later. I really can't do without it. The washing

10
0:02:17.370000-->0:02:26.030000
 is piling up by the minute. I know, I know. My daughter does. My daughter's got two children

11
0:02:26.030000-->0:02:35.090000
 and she won't use her tumble dryer. Oh yeah. I've got two grandchildren, a newborn, three

12
0:02:35.090000-->0:02:45.930000
 weeks old and a, and my other granddaughter is just coming up to three. Yeah. No, I know.

13
0:02:45.930000-->0:02:55.670000
 I was over there yesterday and it was, there's washing everywhere. No, she's got the clothes

14
0:02:55.670000-->0:03:08.650000
 horses and she just puts them in front of the radiators. The mould is really bad. Yeah.

15
0:03:08.770000-->0:03:13.470000
 We were talking about that yesterday, actually. I'm trying to get her to change her mind,

16
0:03:13.470000-->0:03:27.450000
 but she's very, she's very environmentally friendly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I

17
0:03:27.450000-->0:03:42.840000
 totally agree with that. She has the doors open and the windows open. Honestly, I'm the

18
0:03:42.840000-->0:03:47.240000
 same and I get nagged about it all the time, but sometimes you just think there need to

19
0:03:47.240000-->0:03:57.660000
 be bigger things happening for my small contribution to make a difference. Definitely. It was nice

20
0:03:57.660000-->0:04:03.950000
 to meet you. Have a good afternoon. Bye.
