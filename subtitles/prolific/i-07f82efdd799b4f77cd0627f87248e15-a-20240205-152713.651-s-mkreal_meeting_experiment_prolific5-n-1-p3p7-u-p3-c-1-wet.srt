0:00:11.150000-->0:00:14.350000
 Hi. Can you see me okay?

1
0:00:17.990000-->0:00:20.550000
 Yeah, I can. It's weird because I can't see myself.

2
0:00:24.130000-->0:00:25.970000
 So what do we actually have to do?

3
0:00:25.970000-->0:00:26.810000
 We have to just chat.

4
0:00:38.970000-->0:00:39.110000
 Yeah.

5
0:00:39.110000-->0:00:41.290000
 So it sounds like you're based in the UK.

6
0:00:47.860000-->0:00:48.380000
 Oh nice.

7
0:00:48.800000-->0:00:50.460000
 I'm up in Manchester.

8
0:00:52.430000-->0:00:52.650000
 Yeah.

9
0:00:53.550000-->0:00:56.830000
 I know, I think I've got quite a neutral accent.

10
0:00:56.830000-->0:01:00.470000
 Sometimes people are like, oh, are you American? Are you German?

11
0:01:01.350000-->0:01:04.830000
 People never understand. It's quite funny, to be honest.

12
0:01:08.890000-->0:01:10.190000
 Literally my whole life.

13
0:01:10.450000-->0:01:13.270000
 Born and raised, yeah. Born and raised, yeah.

14
0:01:14.030000-->0:01:15.370000
 Yeah, yeah, it's good.

15
0:01:15.450000-->0:01:18.110000
 Sometimes you think about, oh, should I move?

16
0:01:18.110000-->0:01:19.610000
 But then it's like, oh, my family's here.

17
0:01:19.610000-->0:01:20.970000
 It's nice.

18
0:01:24.310000-->0:01:24.570000
 Yeah.

19
0:01:25.800000-->0:01:27.470000
 Have you been out in Manchester before?

20
0:01:27.470000-->0:01:35.570000
 Mm-hmm.

21
0:01:38.700000-->0:01:39.300000
 How cute.

22
0:01:40.320000-->0:01:40.680000
 Mm-hmm.

23
0:01:46.870000-->0:01:47.250000
 Mm-hmm.

24
0:01:52.400000-->0:01:52.880000
 Mm-hmm.

25
0:01:56.030000-->0:01:56.450000
 Yeah.

26
0:01:56.450000-->0:01:57.570000
 It's so cute.

27
0:01:57.570000-->0:02:01.530000
 It's great, to be honest, because it's different suburbs and stuff within Manchester.

28
0:02:01.530000-->0:02:04.930000
 It's a nice bit like a hipster park.

29
0:02:04.930000-->0:02:06.530000
 And then there's where all the students are.

30
0:02:06.530000-->0:02:08.730000
 And then there's obviously the city centre.

31
0:02:08.730000-->0:02:10.450000
 But it's all the different places.

32
0:02:10.450000-->0:02:12.070000
 There are restaurants and stuff.

33
0:02:12.250000-->0:02:13.090000
 Yeah.

34
0:02:13.250000-->0:02:17.090000
 I prefer it because I can't live somewhere that you can't drive, I think.

35
0:02:17.090000-->0:02:18.310000
 Like, I don't know.

36
0:02:18.310000-->0:02:20.630000
 I don't think I could get public transport anywhere.

37
0:02:23.850000-->0:02:24.540000
 Yeah.

38
0:02:26.950000-->0:02:27.910000
 Oh, my God.

39
0:02:33.550000-->0:02:34.770000
 Oh, my God.

40
0:02:36.930000-->0:02:37.810000
 That's crazy.

41
0:02:37.810000-->0:02:39.470000
 So what did you do? You just had to get a taxi?

42
0:02:41.370000-->0:02:41.990000
 Oh, OK.

43
0:02:44.180000-->0:02:44.580000
 Yeah.

44
0:02:50.490000-->0:02:50.930000
 Mm-hmm.

45
0:02:54.170000-->0:02:55.770000
 Oh, no, I work in sales.

46
0:02:57.280000-->0:02:57.680000
 Yeah.

47
0:02:58.760000-->0:02:59.720000
 Software sales.

48
0:02:59.720000-->0:03:01.240000
 So software consulting sales.

49
0:03:01.240000-->0:03:02.100000
 How about you?

50
0:03:06.200000-->0:03:07.880000
 Oh, that sounds interesting.

51
0:03:11.360000-->0:03:11.720000
 Yeah.

52
0:03:15.450000-->0:03:20.700000
 Well, I actually studied psychology initially and then did psychology.

53
0:03:20.700000-->0:03:23.080000
 And then I did a master's a couple of years later.

54
0:03:23.080000-->0:03:26.980000
 But then in COVID, I literally worked in a psychiatric hospital.

55
0:03:26.980000-->0:03:28.760000
 And it scarred me.

56
0:03:28.760000-->0:03:31.060000
 I was like, yeah, I'm not going into psychology.

57
0:03:31.060000-->0:03:33.260000
 And then sort of fell into sales.

58
0:03:33.260000-->0:03:34.980000
 But yeah, I love it.

59
0:03:34.980000-->0:03:35.740000
 It's so fun.

60
0:03:35.740000-->0:03:40.340000
 And I get to work with, like, really big companies and travel a lot.

61
0:03:40.340000-->0:03:45.540000
 Like, last year, I went to, like, 16 countries, but, like, with work.

62
0:03:45.540000-->0:03:47.360000
 And then, like, some of them was work.

63
0:03:47.360000-->0:03:48.780000
 But then some of them was, like, for fun.

64
0:03:49.240000-->0:03:51.180000
 So, yeah, I love that.

65
0:03:51.180000-->0:03:52.060000
 It's so fun.

66
0:03:54.980000-->0:03:56.280000
 Oh, I'm in my 50s.

67
0:03:56.700000-->0:04:03.600000
 I went to, I know, it was like Vietnam, Cambodia, Dubai, Istanbul, Spain,

68
0:04:03.600000-->0:04:05.820000
 Greece, Turkey, Italy.

69
0:04:05.820000-->0:04:07.800000
 All the places.
