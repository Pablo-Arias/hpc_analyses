0:00:09.050000-->0:00:15.110000
 Oh, hello. Hi. Can you hear me? Can you see me? Oh. Oh, good. I've been having a lot of

1
0:00:15.600000-->0:00:21.990000
 technical problems. Has yours been working? All right. Well, this is the first one I've

2
0:00:21.990000-->0:00:27.690000
 managed to connect. I don't know what the connection issue is, but it's working. Anyway,

3
0:00:29.870000-->0:00:35.470000
 how are you? Are you okay? Yeah, not bad. Weather's a bit rubbish, but that's all right.

4
0:00:38.230000-->0:00:48.910000
 Do you have a good weekend? Do you have anything interesting? I went up to see an old school

5
0:00:48.910000-->0:00:54.250000
 friend. It was a party, so I had a really good time. It was a really good party. It's

6
0:00:56.450000-->0:00:58.310000
 just someone I haven't seen for a long time, but they know how to put on a party, and it

7
0:01:00.350000-->0:01:03.250000
 was just a lot of fun. Yeah, yeah, that was nice. I don't go to that many parties, but

8
0:01:05.710000-->0:01:09.350000
 it was a lot of fun, and yeah, yeah. They played loads of music. I've not heard any

9
0:01:09.350000-->0:01:13.310000
 Yeah, they played loads of music I've not heard for ages as well, so it was just

10
0:01:13.550000-->0:01:19.690000
 good memories kind of thing. Yeah, it was really good. Good tune. Where are you in the world?

11
0:01:24.200000-->0:01:35.070000
 All right, but whereabouts in the UK? Oh, Roehampton. Yeah, I worked there years ago.

12
0:01:35.070000-->0:01:40.050000
 There used to be, what was it? It was in the finance department, I think. It used to be just

13
0:01:40.050000-->0:01:48.050000
 it was a little finance job. Yeah, it's on, I'm in London near Ealing, on the Ealing-Brentford

14
0:01:48.050000-->0:01:52.130000
 border. Yeah, but Roehampton, what was that road? I've forgotten what it's called,

15
0:01:52.310000-->0:01:59.710000
 but there's, it's near the hospital, isn't it? Queen Mary's? Queen Mary's Hospital, is that

16
0:01:59.710000-->0:02:06.480000
 right? There's a hospital somewhere around there. I can't remember. Yeah, no, no, no,

17
0:02:06.480000-->0:02:13.140000
 it's Queen Mary's, but have you done many of these sort of experiments or whatever?

18
0:02:13.140000-->0:02:23.410000
 Are you a member of Prolific? You've done lots of, oh, there's some really interesting stuff. I

19
0:02:23.410000-->0:02:29.150000
 mean, there's some not so interesting, but there's some quite good fun. Yeah, but a lot of it,

20
0:02:29.750000-->0:02:36.620000
 oh, a lot of it is, I've been about, no, less than a year, but about eight months maybe,

21
0:02:36.620000-->0:02:42.860000
 but a lot of them are now a training AI, so it's all about training AI to do things. I'm like,

22
0:02:42.860000-->0:02:47.520000
 oh, should I be doing this? I don't know. I don't know if I want AI to take over everything.

23
0:02:51.100000-->0:02:58.860000
 I started last year, yeah, so I just do studies as and when, all the best ones get taken quickly,

24
0:02:58.860000-->0:03:04.600000
 so I usually do about 10p, I get 10p or 15p or whatever, but this is an interesting one, but

25
0:03:04.780000-->0:03:11.600000
 it's a bit more technical, this one, that's the problem. It took me a while to get on the first

26
0:03:11.600000-->0:03:17.760000
 person, I couldn't, she had a problem connecting the second person, I didn't see anything, and so

27
0:03:17.760000-->0:03:18.600000
 you're actually the first.
