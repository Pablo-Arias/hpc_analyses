 Hi, hello. Did you also wait for 50 hours? What is this? I was just

1
0:00:22.140000-->0:00:25.740000
 Yeah, I was just about to cancel it because I was like well

2
0:00:25.740000-->0:00:30.940000
 They said 15 minutes and then another 5 minutes here another 5 minutes there. It's just taking way too long

3
0:00:34.870000-->0:00:44.810000
 How's it going? Oh?

4
0:00:44.810000-->0:00:46.650000
 Yeah, I know it's

5
0:00:46.650000-->0:00:51.890000
 You want you want to hope for the spring, but it's just keeps on getting worse and worse and worse

6
0:00:56.400000-->0:01:01.950000
 No, I'm in London, so it's like we've had maybe I

7
0:01:02.550000-->0:01:06.970000
 Don't know about three minutes of snow a couple of weeks ago

8
0:01:06.970000-->0:01:11.930000
 It didn't even stay, but everyone you know it. Did you know how people are it's like oh my god

9
0:01:11.930000-->0:01:15.630000
 No, everyone's filming, and I'm like it's not even real snow. It's just like

10
0:01:16.400000-->0:01:17.830000
 spring whatever

11
0:01:40.130000-->0:01:42.050000
 But it's probably pretty as well though no

12
0:01:47.460000-->0:01:52.180000
 Because I'm originally from Russia, so I do miss the snow sometimes

13
0:01:55.200000-->0:02:00.390000
 We do get a lot of snow. I mean with it with a global warming. It's a bit different now

14
0:02:00.390000-->0:02:05.750000
 I think well I haven't been home for a while for obvious reasons, but in the winter

15
0:02:05.750000-->0:02:12.230000
 It's now it's a bit more like UK weather it like gets maybe to like minus five

16
0:02:12.230000-->0:02:16.230000
 In the coldest days and then most of the time. It's just like five eight

17
0:02:16.530000-->0:02:33.700000
 Yeah, when I was a kid we we used to have like a countryside house

18
0:02:33.700000-->0:02:39.720000
 And that would happen and my dad absolutely hated it because it's like you can't get through you need to clear all that up and

19
0:02:39.720000-->0:02:44.820000
 Like you need the tractor to actually clean. It's like one man cannot really

20
0:02:47.140000-->0:02:51.660000
 Do that I know good old

21
0:02:51.660000-->0:02:59.940000
 No, it's you know. We're like and I remember as a kid

22
0:03:02.100000-->0:03:04.260000
 We were allowed not to come to school allowed

23
0:03:04.260000-->0:03:10.100000
 So it's not like you know the school gets closed off. It's like we're allowed to not go if it's minus 30

24
0:03:14.490000-->0:03:17.270000
 Yeah, so it's like you know minus 29 hell no wake up go to school

25
0:03:20.970000-->0:03:21.470000
 It's like nobody cares

26
0:03:22.070000-->0:03:30.250000
 Yeah, it surprises me in the UK. It's like you know the second there is a little bit heavier rain

27
0:03:32.070000-->0:03:34.850000
 It's like oh no all the trains stop everything stops, and I'm like when you were building

28
0:03:36.530000-->0:03:39.810000
 Everything did you not know that it rains in the UK you know it's a thing

29
0:03:39.810000-->0:03:48.250000
 It's you know I that's one thing. I cannot understand. It's like the transport is so unreliable here

30
0:04:02.070000-->0:04:02.370000
 Yeah, I know

31
0:04:03.840000-->0:04:04.940000
 Well, it was nice to meet you. I think we've

32
0:04:07.570000-->0:04:08.310000
 They're gonna cut us off in a second
