 Hiya! How are you? Yes, I'm good, thank you. Whereabouts are you located? Oh wow, I'm in Bedfordshire,

1
0:00:25.040000-->0:00:34.460000
 so just kind of outside of London-ish, not too far from there. Oh, there you go, yeah.

2
0:00:34.460000-->0:00:42.440000
 So the whole of Bedfordshire is like, it's freezing. So cold. It is freezing cold. How

3
0:00:42.440000-->0:00:44.800000
 I bet it's bad in Wales, isn't it, at the moment?

4
0:00:55.800000-->0:01:02.520000
 Yeah, yeah, it's such an icy chill here for sure, but yeah, by the sea must be

5
0:01:02.520000-->0:01:13.830000
 really cold as well, so yeah. Oh, I bet, yeah.

6
0:01:17.740000-->0:01:22.840000
 So Biggleswade, I'm not sure if you've heard. Oh, have you heard of it? Most people haven't.

7
0:01:28.890000-->0:01:30.410000
 Yeah, yeah, they mentioned that.

8
0:01:37.600000-->0:01:45.640000
 Yeah. Oh, nice. Oh, lovely. And how long have you been on Prolific for?

9
0:01:51.050000-->0:01:56.250000
 I think I've been on there for about four months now, which is, it started off like,

10
0:01:56.250000-->0:02:01.750000
 yeah, it was like really full on when I first started. I was getting like so many studies a day

11
0:02:01.750000-->0:02:09.010000
 and it's quietened down a lot. Probably, I think after my first month, it went straight down, so.

12
0:02:12.090000-->0:02:17.690000
 Yeah, I do. I'm on the forum. Yeah. Oh, are you on there as well? I check it every day.

13
0:02:28.690000-->0:02:29.570000
 Very much.

14
0:02:36.250000-->0:02:42.330000
 Yeah. Is it rate limiting, isn't it? Is it rate limiting?

15
0:02:42.330000-->0:02:47.250000
 Yeah, rate limiting. That's what they call it. But no, I do like that forum. It's very useful.

16
0:02:47.250000-->0:02:51.830000
 Certainly, if you think you're having a technical issue and then you find out it's an issue with

17
0:02:51.830000-->0:03:04.880000
 the site, you're like, oh, thank God I haven't lost my account. Oh, yeah, massively. I think the

18
0:03:04.880000-->0:03:08.620000
 internet's always like that, though, isn't it? I think when people don't actually see a face,

19
0:03:08.620000-->0:03:12.880000
 they feel like they would behave how they probably wouldn't behave in real life. So,

20
0:03:12.880000-->0:03:19.100000
 I think that's quite common. But I wish we got the same experience that the USA participants

21
0:03:19.100000-->0:03:25.920000
 clearly get. Can you imagine how nice? How lovely that would be to log on and see on your dashboard

22
0:03:25.920000-->0:03:29.700000
 that you have like 40 studies waiting for you. I'd be like, oh, I don't know what to do with myself.

23
0:03:34.700000-->0:03:45.560000
 Yeah, me too. Yeah, me too. I love it. I was surprised we got into this one, actually,

24
0:03:45.560000-->0:03:48.880000
 because I saw it pop up and I was like, oh, I won't get in. And then when it started loading,

25
0:03:48.880000-->0:03:59.920000
 I was like, oh, I'm in. It's so nice. Yes, you too. And I'm glad you're in the Reddit community

26
0:03:59.920000-->0:04:03.440000
 as well. I'll have to put like a little secret sign in there to show you who I am.

27
0:04:05.580000-->0:04:07.140000
 My name's Raina.
