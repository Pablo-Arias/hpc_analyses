 Hi.

1
0:00:12.680000-->0:00:12.900000
 Hi.

2
0:00:12.900000-->0:00:14.550000
 I'm good how are you?

3
0:00:14.730000-->0:00:15.250000
 Your sound is really good.

4
0:00:16.530000-->0:00:16.650000
 I'm Danielle and I'm from Glasgow.

5
0:00:17-->0:00:17.800000
 What about you?

6
0:00:18.160000-->0:00:18.460000
 Okay.

7
0:00:20.580000-->0:00:23.560000
 I'm Danielle and I'm from Glasgow. What about you?

8
0:00:28.830000-->0:00:29.070000
 Okay.

9
0:00:48.850000-->0:00:51.590000
 I was just talking to a girl, she was from Preston.

10
0:00:53.150000-->0:00:58.010000
 So is it cold where you are just now? Yeah.

11
0:01:09.910000-->0:01:10.190000
 Yeah.

12
0:01:13.550000-->0:01:15.590000
 It was minus six this morning.

13
0:01:15.590000-->0:01:20.550000
 So I usually like to go for a walk very early in the morning.

14
0:01:20.550000-->0:01:23.490000
 But I'm a bit scared in case I fall just now.

15
0:01:23.490000-->0:01:25.990000
 So I've been like not going as many walks.

16
0:01:25.990000-->0:01:30.270000
 I tried yesterday and I almost fell about three times

17
0:01:30.270000-->0:01:31.870000
 and I thought I'm just going to pack it in.

18
0:01:31.870000-->0:01:35.190000
 I'm just going to go back home and get into my pyjamas.

19
0:01:35.550000-->0:01:36.890000
 So yeah.

20
0:01:36.890000-->0:01:38.270000
 Yeah, no, definitely.

21
0:01:38.550000-->0:01:40.610000
 Try not to break your neck, do you know what I mean?

22
0:01:40.610000-->0:01:41.590000
 Yeah, so.

23
0:01:46.470000-->0:01:47.830000
 No, I know.

24
0:01:47.830000-->0:01:50.910000
 And it annoys me the fact that it's icy because I'm like

25
0:01:50.910000-->0:01:53.510000
 I really want to go on a walk but, you know,

26
0:01:53.510000-->0:01:54.950000
 better safe than sorry.

27
0:01:54.950000-->0:01:56.310000
 I don't want to break any bones.

28
0:01:56.310000-->0:01:59.310000
 That would be a terrible joke for 2024.

29
0:02:01.450000-->0:02:02.390000
 So yeah.

30
0:02:02.790000-->0:02:03.890000
 Do you work?

31
0:02:16.580000-->0:02:16.600000
 No.

32
0:02:16.600000-->0:02:16.840000
 That's amazing.

33
0:02:16.840000-->0:02:17.500000
 That's good.

34
0:02:17.600000-->0:02:19.740000
 I work up until like one o'clock.

35
0:02:19.740000-->0:02:22.660000
 I'm part-time so I work like nine o'clock to one o'clock.

36
0:02:22.660000-->0:02:24.180000
 So yeah.

37
0:02:24.180000-->0:02:26.060000
 So it worked out well.

38
0:02:26.060000-->0:02:28.420000
 I just sat down, opened the laptop and it came up and I thought,

39
0:02:28.420000-->0:02:29.760000
 right, I'll go for it then.

40
0:02:29.760000-->0:02:30.960000
 Why not?

41
0:02:30.960000-->0:02:32.320000
 I don't know why not.

42
0:02:32.320000-->0:02:33.020000
 It's good.

43
0:02:33.020000-->0:02:34.560000
 The studies are really good.

44
0:02:34.560000-->0:02:35.060000
 They are.

45
0:02:35.060000-->0:02:35.800000
 I really enjoy them.

46
0:02:35.800000-->0:02:38.740000
 So it's good to get a bit of cash.

47
0:02:40.030000-->0:02:41.150000
 £5, I know.

48
0:02:41.150000-->0:02:42.810000
 Yeah, definitely.

49
0:02:42.850000-->0:02:45.750000
 Because it builds up so quickly.

50
0:02:47.930000-->0:02:48.770000
 It does build up.

51
0:02:48.770000-->0:02:49.610000
 So that's really good.

52
0:02:49.610000-->0:02:50.110000
 Yeah.

53
0:02:55.500000-->0:02:57.440000
 Yeah.

54
0:02:57.440000-->0:02:57.620000
 Yeah.

55
0:03:01.660000-->0:03:02.380000
 Yeah.

56
0:03:04.600000-->0:03:05.120000
 Yeah.

57
0:03:09.570000-->0:03:10.170000
 Yeah.

58
0:03:13.330000-->0:03:16.050000
 I think some of them, like some of them will be like,

59
0:03:16.050000-->0:03:17.130000
 oh, it's only two participants.

60
0:03:17.350000-->0:03:19.650000
 And as soon as it pops up, I click on it and it's gone.

61
0:03:19.650000-->0:03:21.050000
 It's like completely gone.

62
0:03:21.350000-->0:03:22.390000
 Oh, okay.

63
0:03:25.200000-->0:03:26.500000
 Yeah, definitely.

64
0:03:27.440000-->0:03:27.900000
 Yeah.

65
0:03:36.500000-->0:03:36.840000
 I don't know.

66
0:03:41.200000-->0:03:42.740000
 I don't know.

67
0:03:42.740000-->0:03:45.540000
 I was actually sitting last week with my, was it Friday?

68
0:03:45.800000-->0:03:49.100000
 I was sitting with my little girl and the two of us were watching a movie and I had the laptop up.

69
0:03:49.100000-->0:03:54.980000
 And then the next minute it came up and it was like, I had to look at these dots on like this image.

70
0:03:54.980000-->0:03:57.940000
 So I ended up, I done it and I think I got like £3 for it.

71
0:03:57.940000-->0:03:59.200000
 But it was like a Friday night.

72
0:03:59.800000-->0:04:01.760000
 And I'm like, I'm so sad sitting down on a Friday night.

73
0:04:07.170000-->0:04:07.750000
 Yeah, I don't know.

74
0:04:07.750000-->0:04:08.690000
 I don't know.
