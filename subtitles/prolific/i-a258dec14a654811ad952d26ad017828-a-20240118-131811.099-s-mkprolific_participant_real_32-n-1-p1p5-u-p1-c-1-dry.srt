 Hello? Yeah I can hear you. Can you hear me? Yeah. No I think we just asked as if we've

1
0:00:28.380000-->0:00:35.270000
 met each other in like a bar or something. So I suppose first question, what's your name?

2
0:00:40.830000-->0:00:58.590000
 I'm Claire and I live in Derbyshire. Yeah we're not, we're not too far from there. Yeah

3
0:00:58.590000-->0:01:06.080000
 it goes Derby, Derby, Chesterfield, Sheffield I think. Because Sheffield's like just under

4
0:01:06.080000-->0:01:15.100000
 Sheff, Chesterfield is just under Sheffield so it's not too far. Yeah, I live in the middle

5
0:01:15.100000-->0:01:19.340000
 of nowhere so there's countryside everywhere which is really good because we've got a dog

6
0:01:19.340000-->0:01:36.320000
 so. She's a boxer cross dog to Bordeaux. Yeah we, yeah we have, we have cats too. We have

7
0:01:36.320000-->0:01:58.470000
 nine cats. Nope, not that I know of. Yeah, unless it's jumped down, it might have jumped

8
0:01:58.470000-->0:02:12.020000
 down like, no you can't see me. We took some on as rescues and then we had a male cat that

9
0:02:12.020000-->0:02:30.910000
 we didn't know was male and got one of ours pregnant so. Yeah the dog gets on really well

10
0:02:30.910000-->0:02:42.570000
 with them as well. I think she thinks she's one of them. But we lost, we lost our oldest one just

11
0:02:42.570000-->0:02:50.980000
 after Christmas. She was like 15 and, and she just, she had a stroke and there was nothing they

12
0:02:50.980000-->0:02:57.790000
 could do. They said it's, she's just gonna go in a, and she went to sleep and that were it. So,

13
0:02:57.790000-->0:03:04.700000
 but I suppose you have to get kind of, because most of our, quite a few of our cats are elderly

14
0:03:04.700000-->0:03:20.560000
 now so, you know, it's, yeah. A couple of the others, we've got an eight-year-old, a nine-year-old

15
0:03:20.560000-->0:03:35.620000
 and a ten-year-old so they're getting, they are in their retirement now. No, the one, the one that

16
0:03:35.620000-->0:03:40.500000
 we lost just after Christmas, she was still acting like a kitten. All of a sudden she was just,

17
0:03:40.500000-->0:03:44.660000
 one minute she was running around, the next minute she was just laying on the step, on the stairs,

18
0:03:44.660000-->0:03:51.840000
 couldn't move. She'd lost all movement, rang the vets, we got her ready to go to the vets and she

19
0:03:51.840000-->0:04:08.800000
 passed away within half an hour. So, yeah, yeah. 15 seconds. Yeah. Yeah, you too.
