 Hi, can you hear me?

1
0:00:24.350000-->0:00:24.390000
 I'm sorry.

2
0:00:26.440000-->0:00:26.560000
 I guess my earphones are bad.

3
0:00:26.560000-->0:00:32.030000
 I'm sorry.

4
0:00:32.030000-->0:00:34.970000
 I live in Hull, how about you?

5
0:00:40.060000-->0:00:40.100000
 Oh, wow.

6
0:00:40.100000-->0:00:44.400000
 That's a place I would like to come to.

7
0:00:49.680000-->0:00:49.740000
 It sounds interesting.

8
0:00:54.560000-->0:00:54.620000
 Really, really cool.

9
0:00:54.620000-->0:00:56.620000
 Thank you so much.

10
0:00:56.940000-->0:01:00.700000
 Really, how cold is it now?

11
0:01:06.600000-->0:01:08.390000
 I love that.

12
0:01:09.270000-->0:01:11.750000
 It's about minus 6, and there's no snow.

13
0:01:13.010000-->0:01:14.600000
 I would really love to see the snow.

14
0:01:17.350000-->0:01:24.630000
 I just don't like the cold.

15
0:01:24.630000-->0:01:25.590000
 I don't like the cold, but I like snow.

16
0:01:32.180000-->0:01:33.640000
 So it snows every year.

17
0:01:53.160000-->0:01:53.700000
 So how do you guys

18
0:01:53.700000-->0:01:56.580000
 go out or have fun

19
0:01:56.580000-->0:01:58.560000
 in school, even in the cold?

20
0:01:59.160000-->0:02:00.100000
 Do you guys have that?

21
0:02:10.650000-->0:02:13.690000
 Yeah, your dogs used to walk them in the snow.

22
0:02:17.170000-->0:02:18.830000
 Wow, what kind of dogs are those?

23
0:02:21.400000-->0:02:22.360000
 Oh, wow.

24
0:02:23.420000-->0:02:24.350000
 Both are cocker spaniels.

25
0:02:31.010000-->0:02:33.820000
 I want to get one.

26
0:02:34.600000-->0:02:36.220000
 I used to have one back at home in Nigeria.

27
0:02:41.850000-->0:02:43.250000
 I had the Boabo, so I'm hoping to get one.

28
0:02:47.740000-->0:02:50.620000
 I don't really see a lot of Boabos here.

29
0:02:50.780000-->0:02:52.100000
 I see a lot of cocker spaniels.

30
0:03:07.550000-->0:03:07.570000
 Poodles.

31
0:03:07.570000-->0:03:09.310000
 Even a Labrador, I wouldn't mind.

32
0:03:09.650000-->0:03:11.350000
 I just want a dog soon.

33
0:03:12.740000-->0:03:14.640000
 They're so nice to have around.

34
0:03:20.450000-->0:03:23.360000
 I'm a student, so

35
0:03:23.360000-->0:03:26.850000
 I do part-time work

36
0:03:32.660000-->0:03:33.700000
 and I have school too.

37
0:03:39.780000-->0:03:48.050000
 I'm still a physiotherapist

38
0:03:48.050000-->0:03:49.710000
 because I still have my clinic running.

39
0:03:50.610000-->0:03:52.270000
 I just want to go back.

40
0:03:56-->0:03:56.680000
 What about you, what do you do?

41
0:04:00.890000-->0:04:02.270000
 Wow.

42
0:04:05.250000-->0:04:08.420000
 It's interesting.
