 Heyya, you alright? Yeah, you too. What's your name? Claire. Where are you about to

1
0:00:28.390000-->0:00:40.760000
 leave the country from? Pardon? Yeah, I'm from Derbyshire. It's right in the middle

2
0:00:40.760000-->0:00:48.130000
 of the country. Yeah, it's in the middle of, yeah, it's not, I don't think it's far. It's

3
0:00:48.130000-->0:01:02.890000
 in the Midlands, Derbyshire. It's a really big county, it's one of the biggest, I think

4
0:01:02.890000-->0:01:12.680000
 it's one of the biggest counties in the country, other than London, I think. I think. Yeah,

5
0:01:12.680000-->0:01:19.430000
 it's just below, just below Yorkshire, between Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. It's right

6
0:01:19.430000-->0:01:41.220000
 in the middle. Yeah, it's just, I live just about 20 minutes from Derby, so, but I'm more

7
0:01:41.220000-->0:01:54.540000
 in the countryside, so, in the middle of nowhere. Yeah, it is some beautiful places if you like

8
0:01:54.540000-->0:02:02.250000
 walking and it's really quiet where I live. It was minus six this morning when my son

9
0:02:02.250000-->0:02:30.070000
 got up for school. Yeah, me too. Where I live it's really quiet, but I think more people

10
0:02:30.070000-->0:02:37.960000
 are friendlier than they are in London, from what I've heard. People have weird accents

11
0:02:37.960000-->0:02:45.560000
 where I'm from, nobody can understand what we say. Yeah, but mine's not a really broad

12
0:02:45.560000-->0:02:51.520000
 accent because I've lived, I've lived up north, I've lived in Newcastle, I've lived, you know,

13
0:02:51.520000-->0:02:57.650000
 quite different places, so my accent's probably changed. But like my grandfather, his accent

14
0:02:57.650000-->0:03:17.470000
 was really broad and nobody could understand him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just a stay-at-home mum

15
0:03:17.470000-->0:03:23.030000
 at the minute. My youngest son's just gone to secondary school, so I am looking for work,

16
0:03:23.030000-->0:03:28.650000
 but it's really hard because of where I live. It's in the middle of nowhere and I don't drive,

17
0:03:28.650000-->0:03:45.040000
 so it's going to have to be something really local. Yeah. I've never worked because I had

18
0:03:45.040000-->0:04:05.870000
 my first son at 17, so I've always been just a mum. Just been a mum and that's it. Yeah.

19
0:04:08.100000-->0:04:09.500000
 Yeah, I have an adult.
