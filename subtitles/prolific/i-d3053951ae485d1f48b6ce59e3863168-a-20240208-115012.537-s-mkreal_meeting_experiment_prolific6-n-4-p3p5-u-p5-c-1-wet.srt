 Hi, not much, not much, just finding it really weird to chat to random people on the internet.

1
0:00:19.240000-->0:00:29.490000
 Yeah, it's interesting people.

2
0:00:29.490000-->0:00:31.290000
 I wonder if we talk to the same people.

3
0:00:31.290000-->0:00:35.360000
 I'm assuming you're the only guy that I've spoken to so far.

4
0:00:35.360000-->0:00:36.140000
 I was all ladies.

5
0:00:41.400000-->0:00:43.230000
 You've spoken to someone else.

6
0:00:49.680000-->0:00:51.940000
 Interesting, because I've had three ladies.

7
0:00:51.940000-->0:00:54.080000
 You're the only guy near my last conversation.

8
0:01:03.050000-->0:01:09.370000
 I wonder how many people are taking part in this at the moment, because it says that there's 12 places taken.

9
0:01:09.370000-->0:01:14.470000
 So obviously, yeah, I guess that could be if we're talking to...

10
0:01:17.080000-->0:01:19.980000
 My math is not mathing today.

11
0:01:19.980000-->0:01:23.480000
 I haven't even had breakfast yet, so I'm not...

12
0:01:24.080000-->0:01:31
 I can't concentrate and focus on how many people are taking part and how many combinations of people you can have.

13
0:01:39.860000-->0:01:41.480000
 Yeah, but it was a bit of a wait, though.

14
0:01:41.480000-->0:01:44.920000
 It said 35 minutes, but it's been longer than 35 minutes now.

15
0:01:44.920000-->0:01:57.740000
 Yeah.

16
0:02:00.250000-->0:02:08.500000
 Oh, I've been for a couple of years, I think since like 2018, 2019.

17
0:02:08.500000-->0:02:18.900000
 Yeah, I've only found out about this because I've used it on the opposite side as well as a researcher.

18
0:02:18.900000-->0:02:28.110000
 So I was like, you know, if I'm using it to recruit people and pay people, why don't I actually do it myself?

19
0:02:28.110000-->0:02:31.930000
 I think when I started, it wasn't very busy.

20
0:02:31.930000-->0:02:38.640000
 So it wasn't really, you know, you could maybe get something like once a week.

21
0:02:38.640000-->0:02:42.060000
 If you're lucky, like it wasn't there wasn't a lot of people on.

22
0:02:42.060000-->0:02:51.220000
 And I think it was when the pandemic started that obviously people had to move everything to online and they weren't able to do any in-person data collection.

23
0:02:51.220000-->0:02:57.140000
 That's when it started really booming and you started getting a lot, a lot of studies every day.

24
0:02:57.140000-->0:02:59.700000
 And, you know, sometimes it depends on a day.

25
0:02:59.700000-->0:03:09.030000
 Like, I think I think the most I've made in a day was like 150 pounds once in a day.

26
0:03:09.030000-->0:03:13.790000
 Yeah, it was just a very it was a very lucky day.

27
0:03:14.250000-->0:03:24
 There was there was this like really random study where basically you had to and you could do multiple submissions.

28
0:03:24-->0:03:27.320000
 They had like 10,000 spaces and you could do multiple submissions.

29
0:03:27.320000-->0:03:33.580000
 And they would let you they would let you listen to a sentence said in a very strange.

30
0:03:33.580000-->0:03:37.020000
 Well, not in a strange like with with emotion.

31
0:03:37.020000-->0:03:41.020000
 And you had to replicate like you had to say the same sentence with the same emotion.

32
0:03:41.100000-->0:03:48.100000
 And based on how accurate you were, basically, for like about 15 minutes, they were paying like seven pounds.

33
0:03:48.800000-->0:03:51.600000
 And I just did it like endlessly.

34
0:03:57.350000-->0:03:57.950000
 Anastasia.
