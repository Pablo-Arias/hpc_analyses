 Hi, I'm so sorry about that. I switched it off by mistake. Can you hear me? I'm sorry

1
0:00:17.070000-->0:00:23.250000
 about that. Yeah, I can. I'm just going to, I really am going to turn the sound off. Let

2
0:00:23.250000-->0:00:27.630000
 me turn my headphones up a little bit. That's it. Right. Yeah. So what, do we just have

3
0:00:27.630000-->0:00:46.340000
 to talk to each other? Yeah. No. Well, hi, whereabouts do you live? Kent. Sorry? Yeah.

4
0:00:46.340000-->0:00:56.580000
 I'm in South London in Clapham. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know

5
0:00:56.580000-->0:01:15.020000
 the area at all, but is it a nice place to live? Yeah. Is it? Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, maybe

6
0:01:15.020000-->0:01:20.020000
 I would because I always think, wouldn't it be nice to move out of London? But I think

7
0:01:20.020000-->0:01:33.770000
 if I did move out, I might find it boring. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I bet it is. Yeah. It couldn't

8
0:01:33.770000-->0:01:38.560000
 be more expensive. Yeah. Well, sadly, I live just around the corner for you heard about

9
0:01:38.560000-->0:01:43.380000
 that awful attack in the street the other day. Did you hear about the man who attacked

10
0:01:43.380000-->0:01:50
 a woman? It's just around the corner from me. Yes. So at the moment I'm thinking, oh,

11
0:01:50-->0:01:59.630000
 I really don't want to live here, but, you know, I'll probably change my mind. Yeah,

12
0:01:59.630000-->0:02:09.730000
 I know it's horrible. Well, I was in Brixton for about 20 years and then I moved here 17

13
0:02:09.730000-->0:02:15.350000
 years ago. So it's South London quite a long time. And I grew up in Croydon. So I've always

14
0:02:15.350000-->0:02:38.350000
 been around South London. Oh, right. Yeah. Oh, it's funny, isn't it? You get stuck, really.

15
0:02:39.450000-->0:02:44.550000
 Well, I'm lucky enough to have a housing association flat, so I'd be a fool to move,

16
0:02:44.550000-->0:02:51.850000
 really, because, you know, it's nice. It's secure and quite nice neighbours and everything. So

17
0:02:52.090000-->0:03:01.130000
 I probably stay here forever. Yeah. Are you working? Have you got family to look after?

18
0:03:01.130000-->0:03:13.700000
 What do you do with your time? Yeah. Right. Very wise. Yeah. No, I haven't got children either.

19
0:03:13.700000-->0:03:21.560000
 I've just got a very demanding dog. Conversation over in 15 seconds. I know it was, wasn't it?

20
0:03:21.560000-->0:03:26.980000
 Well, very nice to meet you anyway. It's so weird. So weird.
