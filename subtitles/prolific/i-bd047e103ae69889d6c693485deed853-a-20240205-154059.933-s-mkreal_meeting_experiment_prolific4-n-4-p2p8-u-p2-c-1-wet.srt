0:00:06.600000-->0:00:09.540000
 Hello, how are you?

1
0:00:13.780000-->0:00:16.340000
 Yeah, I've been doing well, thank you so much.

2
0:00:19.490000-->0:00:21.810000
 Okay, how long have you been in Portofeuille?

3
0:00:21.810000-->0:00:26.960000
 How long have you been in Portofeuille?

4
0:00:31.550000-->0:00:37.980000
 Uh, you just said cut it off, can you repeat it again, please?

5
0:00:46.980000-->0:00:48.200000
 Oh, recently, okay.

6
0:00:48.200000-->0:01:00.680000
 I've been about one and a half year, but you know I'm very busy so I don't spend a lot of time on taking studies, so it depends on my time.

7
0:01:06.110000-->0:01:10.770000
 I'm doing my PhD in London, UCL.

8
0:01:11.170000-->0:01:12.090000
 How about you?

9
0:01:16.090000-->0:01:16.750000
 In London.

10
0:01:16.750000-->0:01:23.080000
 Oh, good, good to know.

11
0:01:23.080000-->0:01:27.330000
 How do you find Portofeuille?

12
0:01:27.950000-->0:01:32.570000
 Sarah, how are you?

13
0:01:33.790000-->0:01:34.390000
 What's your name?

14
0:01:35.400000-->0:01:36.780000
 Yeah, I'm Sarah.

15
0:01:41.210000-->0:01:42.630000
 Nice to meet you as well.

16
0:01:43.250000-->0:01:45.590000
 How do you find Portofeuille?

17
0:01:45.590000-->0:01:49.050000
 Can you find it's useful for you to earn money?

18
0:01:49.250000-->0:02:07.610000
 What's your major?

19
0:02:12.490000-->0:02:14.230000
 Oh, good, good.

20
0:02:14.230000-->0:02:18.920000
 How do you find London?

21
0:02:20.950000-->0:02:24.230000
 For me, the story is different.

22
0:02:24.230000-->0:02:35.090000
 I don't rely on money, actually, because I got a scholarship in London, and I have a stipend, so I don't need to pay.

23
0:02:35.090000-->0:02:41.070000
 But for me, it's kind of a game, to be honest.

24
0:02:41.070000-->0:02:43.230000
 That's why I don't spend a lot of time.

25
0:02:43.230000-->0:02:50.530000
 Maybe I earn two or three pounds every day, and I don't do a lot.

26
0:02:50.750000-->0:02:53.230000
 Just a few tasks every day.

27
0:02:53.230000-->0:02:56.270000
 Sometimes I earn more, sometimes I earn less.

28
0:02:56.270000-->0:03:01.290000
 It depends on my job schedule, because also I'm teaching, so I don't have a lot of time.

29
0:03:01.950000-->0:03:08.230000
 But yeah, exactly, it's based on my availability.

30
0:03:08.230000-->0:03:20.670000
 To be honest, it's kind of helped me to cope with the stress when I need to do a lot of jobs.

31
0:03:20.670000-->0:03:22.730000
 Sometimes it's kind of playing a game.

32
0:03:22.730000-->0:03:24.970000
 I don't take it seriously.

33
0:03:25.250000-->0:03:33.170000
 It's kind of just playing a game sometimes to forget about everything and just focus on that.

34
0:03:34.500000-->0:03:41.570000
 But if you go out, for example, even here, teaching is much more, they pay you more than this.
