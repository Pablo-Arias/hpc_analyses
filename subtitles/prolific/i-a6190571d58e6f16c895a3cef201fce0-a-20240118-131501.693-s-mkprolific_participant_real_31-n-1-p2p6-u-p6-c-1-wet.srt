 Hiya! How are you? Yes, I'm good, thank you. Whereabouts are you located?

1
0:00:21.300000-->0:00:29.540000
 Oh wow, I'm in Bedfordshire, so just kind of outside of London-ish, not too far from there.

2
0:00:29.540000-->0:00:42.250000
 Oh, there you go, yeah, so half of here is like, it's freezing, so cold, it is freezing cold.

3
0:00:42.250000-->0:00:44.810000
 How about, I bet it's bad in Wales, isn't it, at the moment?

4
0:00:55.750000-->0:01:05
 Yeah, yeah, it's such an icy chill here for sure, but yeah, by the sea must be really cold as well, so yeah.

5
0:01:10.900000-->0:01:13.820000
 Oh, I bet, yeah.

6
0:01:17.600000-->0:01:22.820000
 So, Biggleswade, I'm not sure if you've heard of it. Oh, have you heard of it? Most people haven't.

7
0:01:23.600000-->0:01:27.770000
 The book, The Grown-ups, is a great book.

8
0:01:27.950000-->0:01:30.410000
 Yeah, they mentioned that.

9
0:01:30.410000-->0:01:32.650000
 Yeah, it's a really lovely book.

10
0:01:41.200000-->0:01:41.220000
 Yeah.

11
0:01:41.220000-->0:01:45.630000
 Oh, nice. Oh, lovely. And how long have you been on Prolific for?

12
0:01:46.900000-->0:01:49.790000
 I've been on there for a couple of years now.

13
0:01:50.650000-->0:01:59.530000
 I think I've been on there for about four months now, which is, it started off like, yeah, it was like really full on when I first started.

14
0:01:59.530000-->0:02:03.790000
 I was getting like so many studies a day and it's quietened down a lot.

15
0:02:03.790000-->0:02:09.030000
 Probably, I think after my first month, it went straight down, so.

16
0:02:11.700000-->0:02:14.540000
 Yeah, I do. I'm on the forum.

17
0:02:14.960000-->0:02:17.700000
 Yeah. Oh, are you on there as well? I check it every day.

18
0:02:28.100000-->0:02:29.560000
 Very much.

19
0:02:32.050000-->0:02:36.980000
 Yeah.

20
0:02:37.760000-->0:02:42.280000
 They call it rate limiting, isn't it? Is it rate limiting?

21
0:02:42.280000-->0:02:47.240000
 Yeah, rate limiting. That's what they call it. But no, I do like that forum. It's very useful.

22
0:02:47.240000-->0:02:54.220000
 Certainly, if you think you're having a technical issue and then you find out it's an issue with the site, you're like, oh, thank God I haven't lost my account.

23
0:03:00.350000-->0:03:01.890000
 Oh, yeah, massively.

24
0:03:03.950000-->0:03:12.630000
 I think the Internet's always like that, though, isn't it? I think when people actually see a face, they feel like they would behave how they probably wouldn't behave in real life.

25
0:03:12.630000-->0:03:19.910000
 So I think that's quite, quite common. But I wish we got the same experience that the USA participants clearly get.

26
0:03:19.910000-->0:03:28.090000
 Can you imagine how nice, how lovely that would be to log on and see on your dashboard that you have like 40 studies waiting for you.

27
0:03:28.090000-->0:03:29.730000
 I'd be like, oh, I don't know what to do with myself.

28
0:03:39.800000-->0:03:47.830000
 Me too. Yeah, me too. I love it. I was surprised we got into this one, actually, because I saw it pop up and I was like, oh, I won't get in.

29
0:03:47.830000-->0:03:52.810000
 And then when it started loading, I was like, oh, I'm in. It's so nice.

30
0:03:52.950000-->0:04:03.450000
 Yes, you too. And I'm glad you're in the Reddit community as well. I'll have to put like a little secret sign in there to show you who I am.

31
0:04:05.150000-->0:04:07.110000
 My name's Raina.
