 Hey! I'm fine, thank you. How are you? I'm from Turkey, but I live in the UK. No, I'm

1
0:00:28.360000-->0:00:53.620000
 in the UK. I live in Exeter. And you? Oh, you married a British person? Okay, I think

2
0:00:53.740000-->0:01:06.420000
 it's a bit similar because I have a British boyfriend as well. Actually, I got a scholarship

3
0:01:06.420000-->0:01:14.500000
 and I am doing my masters at the moment. Apart from studies, I also have a British boyfriend

4
0:01:14.820000-->0:01:22.780000
 and I think it's just, you know, meant to be, I think. So, I'm here. It wasn't planned,

5
0:01:22.780000-->0:01:30.080000
 but I'm here for almost like six months now and it's been great, actually. Have you ever

6
0:01:30.080000-->0:01:50.020000
 been to Exeter? Oh, really? Oh, really? Oh, that's great. I mean, it's such a coincidence

7
0:01:50.020000-->0:01:57.260000
 that we both got scholarships and we're talking to each other at the moment. And where do

8
0:01:57.260000-->0:02:25.440000
 you live right now? Is it nice? Do you like living in Brantford? I think I would say

9
0:02:25.440000-->0:02:32.800000
 the same thing for Exeter, to be honest. It's very green and it's small, but it's very close

10
0:02:32.800000-->0:02:38.660000
 to Bristol. So, if you want something to do, you know, you can go very quickly and it's just a

11
0:02:38.660000-->0:02:47.280000
 very big city. But Exeter is always friendly to me. It's been really easy for me to adapt and

12
0:02:47.280000-->0:02:53.740000
 I quite like living here because you can walk everywhere and it's just so nice to be on the

13
0:02:53.740000-->0:03:00.300000
 quayside. I just really, really like it, to be honest. I mean, the weather is nice. It's grey

14
0:03:00.300000-->0:03:18.800000
 at the moment, but it's usually warmer than the other parts of the UK. I am studying, teaching

15
0:03:18.800000-->0:03:40.580000
 English. Yeah. I actually work as an English lecturer at my hometown in Turkey, but since I'm

16
0:03:40.580000-->0:03:48.100000
 trying to change some life over here, I don't know what I'm going to do here, but I think I might

17
0:03:48.100000-->0:03:56.320000
 even do something else. I'm just trying to figure out what I might plan for the future. But I quite

18
0:03:56.320000-->0:04:04.360000
 enjoy it. It's something I've been doing for 10 years. It's just hard to find a job because you're

19
0:04:04.360000-->0:04:09.620000
 not a native speaker and you're teaching English. So, this is...
