 Hello, my name's Chris and I'm from Scotland.

1
0:00:20.150000-->0:00:41.050000
 Ah, Raj, I've never been to Birmingham itself, although many years ago I spent one day in

2
0:00:41.050000-->0:00:45.170000
 Birmingham at a conference centre, but I don't know Birmingham.

3
0:00:57.190000-->0:00:57.970000
 Oh yes.

4
0:00:58.950000-->0:01:07.750000
 Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland and I live south of Glasgow.

5
0:01:08.190000-->0:01:12.050000
 Now, Edinburgh is on the east coast.

6
0:01:12.050000-->0:01:18.230000
 Glasgow is at a similar level, but on the west coast of Scotland.

7
0:01:18.230000-->0:01:22.870000
 I think it's about 30 miles from Edinburgh.

8
0:01:37.100000-->0:01:41.920000
 Yeah, and may I ask what do you do in Birmingham?

9
0:01:57.800000-->0:01:59.170000
 You work in an office?

10
0:01:59.350000-->0:01:59.930000
 Yeah.

11
0:02:00.350000-->0:02:12.760000
 Well, yeah, I'm in my seventies now and before I retired I was a midwife.

12
0:02:18.500000-->0:02:21.060000
 I enjoyed being a midwife.

13
0:02:21.060000-->0:02:34.180000
 I loved helping mums delivering their babies, but it became very difficult with shift work

14
0:02:34.900000-->0:02:43.620000
 and when the time came to retire, although I loved my job, I was ready to retire.

15
0:02:43.800000-->0:02:49.250000
 Ah.

16
0:02:57.850000-->0:03:08.370000
 Yeah, it makes you feel tired even when you're off duty, but I loved being a midwife.

17
0:03:09.500000-->0:03:17.010000
 So you're married?

18
0:03:23.850000-->0:03:25.750000
 I've never been married.

19
0:03:26.450000-->0:03:37.690000
 I have quite a number of close family members near to where I live, but I've never been

20
0:03:37.690000-->0:03:40.630000
 married and I don't have any children of my own.

21
0:03:42.450000-->0:03:49.310000
 I, in my younger years I wanted to get married, but I didn't meet the right person.

22
0:04:00.160000-->0:04:09.790000
 Oh, it's been lovely chatting and you.
