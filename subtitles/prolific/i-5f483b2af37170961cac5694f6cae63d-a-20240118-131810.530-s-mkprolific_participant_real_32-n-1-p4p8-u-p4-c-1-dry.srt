 Hi there. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, yeah, I can hear you. Nice to meet you.

1
0:00:22.490000-->0:00:38.530000
 This is a very strange task, isn't it? No, I did one of these, I think, last week

2
0:00:38.530000-->0:00:43.410000
 and you just chat for the four minutes about anything that you want to chat

3
0:00:43.410000-->0:00:52.780000
 about. It's very random. It's easy. So whereabout are you based? Where do you

4
0:00:52.780000-->0:01:06.230000
 live? Okay, yeah, I'm way up north. I'm in Aberdeen. So, yeah, very snowy here just

5
0:01:06.230000-->0:01:20.420000
 now. I don't know what it's like with you. Yeah. Oh, we've got... Yeah, no, it's about a

6
0:01:20.420000-->0:01:28.020000
 foot deep. So, it's bad enough but it could be a lot worse. So, I think there's

7
0:01:28.020000-->0:01:33.640000
 some areas that got it worse than us but we are East Coast so we are probably...

8
0:01:33.640000-->0:01:40.190000
 The West Coast, I think, has got it worse. So, how long have you been on Prolific?

9
0:01:40.190000-->0:02:04.180000
 Okay, wow. Probably under a year. Yeah, a relative newbie. No, I was on a

10
0:02:04.180000-->0:02:09.080000
 waitlist for ages. I'd actually forgotten I'd signed up so it was a

11
0:02:09.080000-->0:02:14.740000
 surprise when I got the email. I was like, what's this about? But, yeah, so, no, but

12
0:02:14.740000-->0:02:34.690000
 it's good fun. Yeah. One of the chats I had in the previous same experiment, it

13
0:02:34.690000-->0:02:39.910000
 was four years the lady had been doing it. So, it must be around for a wee bit.

14
0:02:42-->0:02:53.360000
 It's good fun though. Yeah, some of them are fun. Some of them are a bit strange.

15
0:02:54.080000-->0:02:57.540000
 But it'll be interesting to see because when I did this one before it was four

16
0:02:57.540000-->0:03:03.860000
 females I spoke to. So, I don't know if this is more a female, you know, just

17
0:03:03.860000-->0:03:08.480000
 chatting to random strangers and the men tend to avoid it or we'll see what

18
0:03:08.480000-->0:03:21.900000
 happens this time. Yeah, because I think you can choose not to do video tasks at

19
0:03:21.900000-->0:03:36.340000
 all. So, yeah, I don't mind them. I know, but you look very presentable. I look a lot

20
0:03:36.340000-->0:03:52.350000
 scruffier. Yeah, yeah, you just do the, is it five four-minute chats? So, or four

21
0:03:52.350000-->0:03:56.570000
 four-minute chats or something like that anyway. Oh, that's our warning up now. We

22
0:03:56.570000-->0:04:05.030000
 just get cut off at the end of the 15 seconds. So, it was nice to meet you. Yeah, good luck with your next chat.

23
0:04:07.110000-->0:04:08.750000
 Okay then.
