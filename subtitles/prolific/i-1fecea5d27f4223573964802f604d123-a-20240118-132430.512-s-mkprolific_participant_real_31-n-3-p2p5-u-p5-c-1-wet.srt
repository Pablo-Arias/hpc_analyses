0:01:51.700000-->0:01:58.880000
 Yeah, a couple of years now. Yeah, so I just cuz I work from home

25
0:01:58.880000-->0:02:04.040000

26
0:02:04.040000-->0:02:04.900000
 just

27
0:02:11.100000-->0:02:17.120000
 I've when there's any when there's any issues I go and have a look on there and have a lot but I don't really

28
0:02:17.120000-->0:02:19.960000
 I'm not really looked in there often though

29
0:02:26.980000-->0:02:27.520000
 Yeah

30
0:02:28.400000-->0:02:35.170000
 When they were asking for the address just before Christmas, you know for the payments I had a look on the reddit

31
0:02:35.170000-->0:02:36.870000
 Yeah to see what that was about. Yeah

32
0:02:40.200000-->0:02:41.580000
 Yeah, yeah

33
0:02:42.950000-->0:02:43.620000
 Yeah

34
0:02:44.080000-->0:02:47.480000
 So what do you do for a job? I work in IT. Oh

35
0:02:50.810000-->0:02:51.110000
 Yeah

36
0:02:58.920000-->0:02:59.600000
 Yeah

37
0:02:59.840000-->0:03:07.620000
 So I work from home one day a week before Kovac then Kovac struck. We all went home and never boss at all

38
0:03:07.720000-->0:03:12.360000
 You know, you can come back to work if you want or can stay home. I said I'll stay home

39
0:03:12.360000-->0:03:14.100000
 It's easy with kids and stuff

40
0:03:14.100000-->0:03:18.980000
 So and just quickly nip out and then come back and I can do my washing during the day

41
0:03:22.300000-->0:03:28.530000
 My oldest she's very committed so she was okay working from her, you know doing a school work

42
0:03:28.530000-->0:03:31.010000
 But my younger one she wouldn't do the work

43
0:03:31.010000-->0:03:32.970000
 It was terrible. Yeah

44
0:03:35.050000-->0:03:39.040000
 Yes, there was that as well, yeah, yeah, yeah

45
0:03:39.040000-->0:03:46.240000
 So what no my oldest one she loved school the youngest one not so much. So she enjoyed it. Oh

46
0:03:46.240000-->0:03:52.940000
 The chalk and cheese, yeah. Yeah, if I'd had my foot my youngest first, I wouldn't have had another child

47
0:03:56.300000-->0:03:59.460000
 Yeah, she's a hard work

48
0:04:00.200000-->0:04:06.440000
 Yeah, and yeah, yeah, this is quite a fun study to do where you're talking to other people

49
0:04:06.440000-->0:04:08.320000
 Yeah, and I had one like this before

50
0:04:09.140000-->0:04:09.780000
