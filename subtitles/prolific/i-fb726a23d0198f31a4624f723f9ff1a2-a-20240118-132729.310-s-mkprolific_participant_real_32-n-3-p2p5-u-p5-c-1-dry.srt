0:00:10.050000-->0:00:19.660000
 Hello, hello. How are you? I'm alright. What's your name? Where are you from?

1
0:00:23.750000-->0:00:31.880000
 So I live in Exeter, my name is Annette. You're the second Scottish person I'm talking to today.

2
0:00:31.880000-->0:00:37.220000
 So the lady before was from Aberdeen, so I'm like travelling around Scotland.

3
0:00:37.220000-->0:00:43.220000
 The other lady was from Derbyshire, so yeah, I'm going out, sort of.

4
0:00:43.600000-->0:00:48.700000
 I'm the only person from the south, weirdly, I don't know why it's like that.

5
0:00:49.600000-->0:00:54.630000
 Okay, yeah, so also north, yeah.

6
0:00:59.250000-->0:01:05.370000
 I mean, minus two it was, I think. I don't know, it's six now, apparently,

7
0:01:05.370000-->0:01:11.730000
 because the sun has come out, so it got a lot warmer. But yeah, at night it was quite cold.

8
0:01:11.730000-->0:01:12.630000
 How is it up there?

9
0:01:19.400000-->0:01:42.470000
 Hmm, yeah, oh no, no, yeah, well, yeah, no, it's not worth it.

10
0:01:42.470000-->0:01:47.170000
 Well done on you going on walks, that's really disciplined. I need to start doing that.

11
0:01:53.350000-->0:02:00.680000
 No, yeah, exactly. No, yeah.

12
0:02:04.900000-->0:02:08.700000
 So I work, yeah, so this is my lunch break now from one to two.

13
0:02:08.900000-->0:02:13.960000
 So I got a jingle from Porifia, I was like, yeah, okay, why not, may as well.

14
0:02:20.800000-->0:02:36.670000
 Oh, wow, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, may as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
0:02:41.810000-->0:02:48.730000
 Yeah, I think so, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

16
0:02:48.730000-->0:02:57.330000
 Sometimes I feel like I get a lot of, like, these 13p ones and, like, 20p ones and all of that.

17
0:02:57.330000-->0:03:04.330000
 And then I get a lot of, like, five, three, two, like, it always, like, comes in this, like, lots for me.

18
0:03:04.330000-->0:03:09.590000
 I don't know why, it's weird. Oh, we're not supposed to put our hands up, oh, I broke the rule.

19
0:03:10.350000-->0:03:26.030000
 Whoops. Yeah, I know you, like, literally have to be on it, like, on it, on it, it's crazy.

20
0:03:26.650000-->0:03:32.110000
 So irritating when you also get something, like, late at night and you're like, oh, I can't be bothered.

21
0:03:32.110000-->0:03:37.630000
 And I'm like, who the hell releases a survey at, like, 10pm in Germany?

22
0:03:37.630000-->0:03:40.490000
 And I'm like, what are you doing, guys? Who are you doing?

23
0:03:55.770000-->0:03:59.730000
 Yeah, like, yeah.

24
0:04:01.150000-->0:04:07.250000
 I'm being sad, but they're three quid, so, like, yeah.

25
0:04:08.650000-->0:04:09.130000
 Why not?
