19
0:01:17-->0:01:20.930000
 This has been two months

20
0:01:20.930000-->0:01:21.490000
 It's been like two months now

21
0:01:22.600000-->0:01:23.330000
 So

22
0:01:25-->0:01:26.280000
 The previous account

23
0:01:27-->0:01:29.590000
 Was when I first started

24
0:01:30.350000-->0:01:31.940000
 This is where my account

25
0:01:41.830000-->0:01:41.870000
 My own

26
0:01:41.990000-->0:01:44.050000
 I've been on this for like two months

27
0:01:46.030000-->0:01:46.050000
 Yeah

28
0:01:46.050000-->0:02:03.010000
 There are certain things that I usually do, you know, the browser, I don't really know the name and that's not good because usually that sends it for me, it refuses to give me that info, so I just pay him and then he gives me.

29
0:02:03.010000-->0:02:12.110000
 But there's a trick I normally use, I will share this trick with you. You know when you click on studies it's usually full and you might not be able to do the study.

30
0:02:12.150000-->0:02:36.630000
 So you go to your Chrome extension browser and download this OP auto clicker. So if you download the OP auto clicker and in situations where the study is full, once you have uploaded it, if you keep on loading it with requests, if you give it like maybe 5, 10, 20 minutes, it will finally accept you in.

31
0:02:36.630000-->0:02:49.420000
 So rather than you using your mouse to do that clicking option, that's what the auto clicker will do for you. So once you just move your mouse to the, yeah to keep clear of clicking for you.

32
0:02:49.420000-->0:03:10.860000
 So if you just download it from your extension browser, the OP auto clicker just activates it to claim your study, just alternate study full, study full, study full until finally it opens the study for you.

33
0:03:11.400000-->0:03:28.920000
 The only disadvantage that, the only study that I know that poses a disadvantage is study that is done by a research group. Anybody that uses that research, you know, that particular survey site, research something, it always pushes people out.

34
0:03:28.920000-->0:03:58.020000
 Once this space is filled up, it will tell you that participants for you should return to study. That's a platform that some researchers use that OP auto clicker to study. You cannot take the study. But studies like culture, video studies, parvula and the rest, you can actually do the study. The OP clicker will help you. Once you've done it, you are free to go to your study.

35
0:04:02.840000-->0:04:04.520000
 Me, I'm at enable now.
