 Hi there, hello. How are you? Yes, yes, I can. Can you? Yeah, same for me. I could only

1
0:00:31.640000-->0:00:36.620000
 have like one and a half conversations and the third person, like I could never see anybody.

2
0:00:36.620000-->0:00:49.800000
 So yeah, I don't know. Okay. I thought it was just me. And I thought it because normally my

3
0:00:49.800000-->0:00:54.260000
 internet is good. But today like no, it didn't seem to be working that well. So I thought it

4
0:00:54.260000-->0:01:03.660000
 was just me. Maybe. Yeah, maybe they make it make it like you're getting patient. Maybe.

5
0:01:11.500000-->0:01:21.690000
 And I live near London in Essex. And you? Oh, okay. And are you? Are you getting ready for

6
0:01:21.690000-->0:01:35.210000
 the weekend? Oh, but do you? Do you have any plans or anything for for tomorrow Sunday?

7
0:01:39.580000-->0:01:43.580000
 Oh, that well, it is good weather already. It's not gonna rain, right? So

8
0:01:44.450000-->0:01:50.360000
 but I think it's still too early. Like for it's still quite cold. No, maybe depends on what you

9
0:01:50.360000-->0:02:01.420000
 want to do. Oh, same here. Yeah, I love spring. And it does involve a lot of gardening because

10
0:02:01.420000-->0:02:11.850000
 the winter does a lot of damage to all the plants. And so so yeah, yeah, I'm not that good at it. But

11
0:02:11.850000-->0:02:16.770000
 my husband is so I'm normally just his assistant. I'm just like standing next and then he's like,

12
0:02:16.770000-->0:02:25.350000
 give me this, bring me that. But the our garden is and it faces west. So it doesn't always get

13
0:02:25.350000-->0:02:32.350000
 a good sun. So like half of it is okay. Half of it by now is very muddy, very dark. So every spring,

14
0:02:32.350000-->0:02:54.850000
 you just have to replace the third and India change it a bit. So oh, that's nice. Do you have

15
0:02:54.850000-->0:03:17.660000
 a big garden? Okay. Oh, sounds like sounds like mine as well. So if you have to do it,

16
0:03:17.660000-->0:03:22.280000
 you start getting like all the little stones, little rocks everywhere. So it takes a lot of

17
0:03:22.280000-->0:03:38.140000
 like cleaning. Yeah. I think this year I'm gonna go buy some knee pads or something for my knees

18
0:03:38.140000-->0:03:59.940000
 because every year is the same. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, good luck with the garden. Hopefully you'll make

19
0:03:59.940000-->0:04:04.420000
 a lot of progress this weekend. The days are getting longer. So you'll have a bit like an

20
0:04:04.420000-->0:04:08.720000
 extra 20 minutes or so at the end of the day. Lovely talking to you. Enjoy the
