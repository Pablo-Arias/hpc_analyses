 Hello, how are you?

1
0:00:13.780000-->0:00:16.340000
 I'm doing well, thank you so much

2
0:00:19.490000-->0:00:21.790000
 How long have you been in Portofeuille?

3
0:00:24.450000-->0:00:26.940000
 How long have you been in Portofeuille?

4
0:00:31.740000-->0:00:37.960000
 You just said cut it off, can you repeat it again, please?

5
0:00:37.960000-->0:00:48.220000
 Oh, recently, okay

6
0:00:48.800000-->0:00:52.560000
 I've been about one and a half year

7
0:00:52.800000-->0:00:58.980000
 But, you know, I'm very busy so I don't spend a lot of time on taking studies

8
0:00:58.980000-->0:01:00.680000
 So, it depends on my time

9
0:01:06.110000-->0:01:10.770000
 I'm doing my PhD in London, UCL

10
0:01:11.350000-->0:01:12.090000
 How about you?

11
0:01:16.070000-->0:01:16.790000
 In London

12
0:01:20.700000-->0:01:23.120000
 Oh, good, good to know

13
0:01:25.950000-->0:01:27.610000
 How do you find the prolific?

14
0:01:28.170000-->0:01:28.750000
 Sarah

15
0:01:28.950000-->0:01:32.500000
 How about you?

16
0:01:33.500000-->0:01:34.460000
 What's your name?

17
0:01:35.400000-->0:01:36.810000
 Yeah, I'm Sarah

18
0:01:41.200000-->0:01:42.620000
 Nice to meet you as well

19
0:01:43.300000-->0:01:49.060000
 How do you find prolific? Can you find it useful for you to earn money?

20
0:02:06.780000-->0:02:07.620000
 What's your major?

21
0:02:12.760000-->0:02:14.220000
 Oh, good, good

22
0:02:18.040000-->0:02:18.900000
 How do you find London?

23
0:02:20.750000-->0:02:24.250000
 For me, the story is different

24
0:02:24.250000-->0:02:27.510000
 I don't rely on money, actually

25
0:02:27.510000-->0:02:30.890000
 Because I got a scholarship in London

26
0:02:31.050000-->0:02:35.070000
 And I have a stipend, so I don't need to pay

27
0:02:35.070000-->0:02:41.030000
 But for me, it's kind of a game, to be honest

28
0:02:41.030000-->0:02:43.210000
 That's why I don't spend a lot of time

29
0:02:43.210000-->0:02:48.750000
 Maybe I earn two or three pounds every day

30
0:02:48.750000-->0:02:50.530000
 And I don't do a lot

31
0:02:50.530000-->0:02:53.250000
 Just a few tests every day

32
0:02:53.250000-->0:02:56.270000
 Sometimes I earn more, sometimes I earn less

33
0:02:56.270000-->0:02:58.430000
 It depends on my job schedule

34
0:02:58.430000-->0:03:01.290000
 Because I'm also teaching, so I don't have a lot of time

35
0:03:02.050000-->0:03:08.210000
 But yeah, exactly, it's based on my availability

36
0:03:08.210000-->0:03:17.050000
 And also, to be honest, it's kind of helped me to cope with the stress

37
0:03:17.350000-->0:03:20.690000
 When I need to do a lot of jobs

38
0:03:20.690000-->0:03:22.830000
 Sometimes it's kind of playing a game

39
0:03:23.350000-->0:03:25.010000
 I don't take it seriously

40
0:03:25.350000-->0:03:30.230000
 It's kind of just playing a game sometimes

41
0:03:30.230000-->0:03:33.170000
 To forget about everything and just focus on that

42
0:03:34.530000-->0:03:38.070000
 But if you go out, for example, even here

43
0:03:38.070000-->0:03:39.610000
 Teaching is much more

44
0:03:39.610000-->0:03:41.570000
 They pay you more than this
