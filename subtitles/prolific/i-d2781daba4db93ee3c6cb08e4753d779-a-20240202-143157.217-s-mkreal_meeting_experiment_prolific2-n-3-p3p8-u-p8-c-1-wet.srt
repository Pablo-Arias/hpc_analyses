 Hi. Hi. I'm Chris. It's good to meet you. I'm from Scotland. Oh, you're from Canada.

1
0:00:37.300000-->0:00:50.320000
 Really? May I ask what brought you to Manchester? Ah, that's a very good reason. Now, um, where

2
0:00:50.320000-->0:01:21.640000
 did you meet your husband? Online. Yeah? Ah. Do you miss Canada? Ah. Yeah. Ah. It must

3
0:01:21.640000-->0:01:28.760000
 be difficult, um, being in a completely different country. Have you been made welcome in Manchester?

4
0:01:46.500000-->0:02:01.310000
 Yeah. Oh, I'm glad to hear that. Now, this is interesting because, although I was born

5
0:02:01.310000-->0:02:10.690000
 and brought up in Scotland, um, I, I, before retirement, I was a nurse and I did a one,

6
0:02:10.830000-->0:02:21.530000
 one year academic course in Manchester and I, I, I stayed, um, for that academic year,

7
0:02:21.530000-->0:02:34.730000
 I stayed in Didsbury and, oh, is it? Um, I lived, I lived at the edge of, in Didsbury

8
0:02:34.730000-->0:02:45.920000
 but very close to Withington. Yeah. I've never, I loved it. I thought Manchester was very

9
0:02:45.920000-->0:02:55.710000
 much like Glasgow and I, I've, I've never managed to go back to Manchester but I have

10
0:02:55.710000-->0:03:03.670000
 very happy memories of being a student there. It, it, it, it, it, it was a great place to

11
0:03:03.670000-->0:03:26.750000
 study. Are, are you working? Oh, I hope you're successful. Um, sorry? What did you say? Oh,

12
0:03:27.310000-->0:03:40.390000
 it's the best thing. At my age, it's perfect because I have time. Sorry? No, not at all.

13
0:03:40.390000-->0:03:50.650000
 Um, I see family and friends. Um, I, I'm happy where I live. Um, I go to a church locally

14
0:03:50.770000-->0:03:59.730000
 and have lots, lots of friends there and in the community where I live. I'm very happy

15
0:03:59.730000-->0:04:09.650000
 in retirement. I, yeah, but I do hope you have, have success with your job interview.
