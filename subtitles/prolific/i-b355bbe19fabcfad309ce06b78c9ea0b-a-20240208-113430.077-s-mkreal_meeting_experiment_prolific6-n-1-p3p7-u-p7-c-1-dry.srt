 Hello? It's my postman. Can you pop them over the fence at the end of the drive, please?

 Yeah, no worries. Thank you. Sorry. Sorry, what was that? Um, yeah, we watch a lot of

8
0:02:57.900000-->0:03:03.440000
 movies. We're watching something at the moment. It's not a movie. It's a series on Netflix

9
0:03:03.600000-->0:03:13.450000
 called Griselda. Have you seen that one? It's good, isn't it? Yeah, yeah. We're going to

10
0:03:13.450000-->0:03:19.980000
 watch the last episode. Okay, last episode for us tonight. It's a good one, isn't it?

11
0:03:22.150000-->0:03:36.500000
 Yeah. Yeah, it's good. No, I don't. I used to, but I don't like it now. I don't know,

12
0:03:36.500000-->0:03:42.620000
 really. It used to be good. I think the people on it are there just to be famous. I don't

13
0:03:42.620000-->0:03:45.900000
 think that they're real people. They are.
