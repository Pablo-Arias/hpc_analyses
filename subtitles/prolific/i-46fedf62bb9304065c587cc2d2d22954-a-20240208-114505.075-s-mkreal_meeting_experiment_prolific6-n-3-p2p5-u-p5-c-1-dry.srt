 Hello.

1
0:00:14.310000-->0:00:14.930000
 How are you?

2
0:00:15.170000-->0:00:15.870000
 I'm good.

3
0:00:16.150000-->0:00:16.910000
 Thanks.

4
0:00:16.910000-->0:00:17.710000
 How are you doing?

5
0:00:17.710000-->0:00:28.480000
 Yeah, so far I've seen two people.

6
0:00:31.600000-->0:00:35.520000
 I am based in London, but I'm originally from Russia.

7
0:00:43.460000-->0:00:46.620000
 I've heard this is not the first time I'm hearing this.

8
0:00:46.620000-->0:00:50.640000
 It seems like everyone's a bit up north on this call.

9
0:00:50.640000-->0:00:54.240000
 Yeah, I know.

10
0:00:54.240000-->0:00:59.660000
 We were just talking about it that it's like it snowed in London a couple of weeks ago

11
0:00:59.960000-->0:01:03.240000
 and it was like for about three seconds of snow.

12
0:01:03.420000-->0:01:09.120000
 But then you go on Instagram, it's like, oh my God, it was snowing in London and everyone's

13
0:01:09.120000-->0:01:10.120000
 just filming it.

14
0:01:10.780000-->0:01:15.840000
 And I'm like, you know, I've had many, many decades of snow, like screw that.

15
0:01:16.060000-->0:01:18.120000
 You know, I'm not filming that snow.

16
0:01:30.100000-->0:01:34.520000
 It's I feel like it's in our blood basically to be ice skating.

17
0:01:34.520000-->0:01:37.100000
 I haven't been for a very long time.

18
0:01:37.100000-->0:01:43.460000
 So like I think I last went when I was 14 or 15 and I went this winter with my friends

19
0:01:43.660000-->0:01:48.020000
 and, you know, I just I just stood on it and I and I just went for it.

20
0:01:48.020000-->0:01:51.740000
 And I was like, you know, I haven't I've been out of practice for about 15 years.

21
0:01:51.740000-->0:01:54.240000
 How is it possible that I still know how to do it?

22
0:01:54.240000-->0:01:55.940000
 And it's like it's in your blood.

23
0:01:56.100000-->0:02:11.280000
 You know, you it just came back to me with basically the well, there are like the cool

24
0:02:11.280000-->0:02:12.260000
 organized ones.

25
0:02:12.260000-->0:02:13.080000
 So I'm from Moscow.

26
0:02:13.080000-->0:02:15.260000
 We have one that's on the Red Square.

27
0:02:15.260000-->0:02:18.340000
 So they basically pour it all over the Red Square and it's beautiful.

28
0:02:18.980000-->0:02:22.920000
 Never been there, but there's a lot of like really random ones.

29
0:02:22.920000-->0:02:27.980000
 So there's always like a little football field for kids to play around, like in different

30
0:02:27.980000-->0:02:29.120000
 areas around town.

31
0:02:29.700000-->0:02:33.940000
 And essentially in the winter, they just pour water all over it because you don't really

32
0:02:33.940000-->0:02:36.940000
 need to maintain it or anything, you know, because it's just cold.

33
0:02:37.100000-->0:02:39.380000
 You just pour water and it stays there.

34
0:02:39.380000-->0:02:45.080000
 Whereas again, in London, you know, you paid, I think we paid what, like 25 pounds to go

35
0:02:45.080000-->0:02:50.640000
 for 40 minutes, probably just because, you know, it takes them so much money to actually

36
0:02:50.640000-->0:02:52.960000
 maintain it when it's plus 10 degrees outside.

37
0:02:52.960000-->0:02:56.520000
 How do you even keep the ice being icy?

38
0:03:04.400000-->0:03:05.370000
 Exactly.

39
0:03:05.370000-->0:03:09.850000
 And the fact that you need to pay 25 pounds to go ice skating, I'm like, well, go to Russia,

40
0:03:09.850000-->0:03:10.690000
 it's all free.

41
0:03:10.690000-->0:03:15.370000
 You just go, you know, so you go outside and it's all ice skating.

42
0:03:32.060000-->0:03:32.420000
 Mmm.

43
0:03:33.020000-->0:03:35.700000
 How did you, how did you feel about the minus 12?

44
0:04:01.720000-->0:04:04.140000
 Nice to, nice to meet you as well.

45
0:04:05.810000-->0:04:05.990000
 Bye.
