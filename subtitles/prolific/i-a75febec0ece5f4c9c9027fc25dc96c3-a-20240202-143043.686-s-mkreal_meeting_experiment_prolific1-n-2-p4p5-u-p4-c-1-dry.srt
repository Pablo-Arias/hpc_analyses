4
0:00:48.880000-->0:00:56.910000
 England. Yeah I moved here for my partner he wanted to buy a house here so I

5
0:00:56.910000-->0:01:01.510000
 moved with him about five years ago now so yeah I've been here for five years.

6
0:01:03.910000-->0:01:09.270000
 I do although looking out the window now it is very wet and rainy which is

7
0:01:09.270000-->0:01:20.120000

8
0:01:20.120000-->0:01:28.500000
 anyway good it does exactly and we do have a little garden here in Wales so

9
0:01:28.500000-->0:01:52.780000
 that doesn't mind the rain at all yeah oh perfect yeah that's good nice yeah I

10
0:01:52.780000-->0:01:59.780000

11
0:01:59.780000-->0:02:04.260000

14
0:02:14.970000-->0:02:19.610000

15
0:02:19.610000-->0:02:27.350000
 well for us well we have we have quite a few acres of land but we only actually

16
0:02:27.350000-->0:02:31.030000
 have we only grow vegetables on a little portion of it so I'd say it's just

17
0:02:31.030000-->0:02:40.160000
