 Hi. Hi. I'm good. How are you? Oh, your sound is really good. I'm Danielle and I'm from

1
0:00:22.160000-->0:00:56
 Glasgow. What about you? Okay. I was just talking to a girl, she was from Preston. So

2
0:00:56-->0:01:18.230000
 is it cold where you are just now? Yeah. It was minus six this morning. So I usually like to go

3
0:01:18.230000-->0:01:24.110000
 for a walk very early in the morning. But I'm a bit scared in case I fall just now. So I've been

4
0:01:24.110000-->0:01:30.670000
 like not going as many walks. I tried yesterday and I almost fell about three times and I thought

5
0:01:30.670000-->0:01:36.770000
 I'm just going to pack it in. I'm just going to go back home and get into my pyjamas. So yeah,

6
0:01:37.230000-->0:01:49.490000
 definitely try not to break your neck. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. And it annoys me the

7
0:01:49.490000-->0:01:54.350000
 fact that it's icy because I'm like, I really want to go on a walk, but you know, better safe

8
0:01:54.350000-->0:01:59.130000
 than sorry. I don't want to break any bones. That would be a terrible thing for 2024.

9
0:02:01.130000-->0:02:03.730000
 So yeah. Do you work?

10
0:02:15.310000-->0:02:21.470000
 That's amazing. That's good. I work up until like one o'clock. I'm part time. So I work like nine

11
0:02:21.470000-->0:02:26.650000
 o'clock to one o'clock. So yeah. So it's, so it worked out well. I just sat down,

12
0:02:26.650000-->0:02:31.830000
 opened the laptop and it came up and I thought, right, I'll go for it then. Why not? I don't know.

13
0:02:31.830000-->0:02:35.690000
 Why not? It's good. They're really, the spiders are really good. They are. I really enjoy them.

14
0:02:35.690000-->0:02:44.910000
 So it's good to get a bit of cash. £5, I know. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Because it builds up

15
0:02:44.910000-->0:02:57.410000
 so quickly. Like it does build up. So that's really good. Yeah. Yeah.

16
0:03:04.970000-->0:03:12.070000
 I think some of them, like some of them will be like, oh, it's only two participants. And

17
0:03:12.070000-->0:03:15.730000
 as soon as it pops up, I click on it and it's gone. It's like completely gone.

18
0:03:20.530000-->0:03:20.590000
 Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

19
0:03:36.200000-->0:03:40.480000
 I was actually sitting last week with my, was it Friday?

20
0:03:40.480000-->0:03:44.320000
 With my little girl and the two of us were watching a movie and I had the laptop up.

21
0:03:44.320000-->0:03:48.300000
 Then the next minute it came up and it was like, I had to look at these dots on a pic

22
0:03:48.300000-->0:03:52.900000
 on like this image. So I ended up, I've done it and I think I've got like £3 for it. But

23
0:03:52.900000-->0:03:56.300000
 it was a Friday night and I'm like, I'm so sad sitting down on a Friday night.
