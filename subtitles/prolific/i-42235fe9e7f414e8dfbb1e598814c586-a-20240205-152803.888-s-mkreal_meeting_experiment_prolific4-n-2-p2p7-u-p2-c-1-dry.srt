 Hello? Hello, hi. You were lucky because I couldn't see and I couldn't hear nothing.

1
0:00:27.960000-->0:00:43.810000
 Wow, okay. Nice to meet you. Are you doing a lot of tests like this? Do you do

2
0:00:43.810000-->0:01:08.070000
 participatory model study? Yeah, okay. I did a lot. Actually, I joined the

3
0:01:08.070000-->0:01:14.750000
 prolific, I think, about more than a year ago and mostly I'm interested in AI and

4
0:01:14.750000-->0:01:19.730000
 programming tests they gave me. It's very interesting because you can see how the

5
0:01:19.730000-->0:01:28.450000
 AI system is trained by your question, actually. I like it. Yeah, it's

6
0:01:28.450000-->0:01:43.170000
 very fun. I do love them. I don't know why, because I'm very busy, but in my

7
0:01:43.170000-->0:01:51.050000
 spare time I enjoy doing that. I think it's just kind of... because most of the

8
0:01:51.050000-->0:01:56.750000
 tests is just given by a very good university, so I think the qualities are

9
0:01:56.750000-->0:02:03.910000
 hard and I think I'm learning from them, to be honest. And I'm not a person who

10
0:02:03.910000-->0:02:44.770000
 enjoys playing games, so this is kind of my game, to be honest. Exactly. I think, you

11
0:02:44.770000-->0:02:48.410000
 know, I'm very busy because I'm doing also PhD, so I don't have a lot of time,

12
0:02:48.410000-->0:02:53.350000
 but anytime running code, in the middle of that, I participate in this kind of

13
0:02:53.350000-->0:02:59.430000
 test and I guess it's kind of... I find it's kind of helping me to cope in

14
0:02:59.430000-->0:03:05.210000
 mechanism, kind of coping mechanism when I have a stress. I just forget about everything, I just come to this.

15
0:03:05.210000-->0:03:12.690000
 It's fun. For me, it's just a matter of fun. A little money. Money is not a lot, you know,

16
0:03:12.690000-->0:03:18.930000
 but I'm teaching. I earn more money than this, but I actually... that's fun, you know, just fun.

17
0:03:18.930000-->0:03:36
 Yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. I just consider this as extra bonus or get some money, but

18
0:03:36-->0:03:40.940000
 the main thing is just I'm not very good playing game. For example, my husband

19
0:03:40.940000-->0:03:46.600000
 really likes playing game every time. It's just a way to cope with the stress, but I

20
0:03:46.600000-->0:03:51.220000
 don't have a kind of coping mechanism to stress and a lot of things I'm doing, so

21
0:03:51.220000-->0:03:58.720000
 every time this happens, every time... especially when I'm doing AI and it was

22
0:03:58.720000-->0:04:06.980000
 very interesting. I took a lot of course in a study about AI, how to train AI, and

23
0:04:06.980000-->0:04:09.720000
 it was very interesting and how the...
