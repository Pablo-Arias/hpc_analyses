0:00:20.600000-->0:00:37.240000
 No, neither could I, funnily enough, it was a terrible connection. Are you okay? No, I

1
0:00:37.240000-->0:00:45.370000
 don't know. I think we're participants. I think we have to, yeah, for just, I think

2
0:00:45.370000-->0:00:49.750000
 they want to see how new people get on when meeting. We have to talk for four minutes

3
0:00:49.750000-->0:01:00.120000
 and then literally it just goes dead. That's a good way to put it. I'm based in Essex in

4
0:01:00.120000-->0:01:16.850000
 the UK. Oh, oh my God, we have rain. Not snow yet, but we have rain, bad rain today. I know,

5
0:01:16.850000-->0:01:27.950000
 definitely. I'm so ready for it now. I'm fed up with big jumpers. Yeah, definitely. It

6
0:01:27.950000-->0:01:37.170000
 was light here. Sorry, my cat. Yeah, yesterday I came home. I got home about half five yesterday

7
0:01:37.170000-->0:01:52.640000
 and it was still light. So that was really nice. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's good.

8
0:01:52.640000-->0:02:09.300000
 What are you up to today then? Anything exciting? It's as exciting as my life. I've got someone

9
0:02:09.300000-->0:02:18.260000
 coming to fix my tumble dryer later. I really can't do without it. The washing is piling

10
0:02:18.260000-->0:02:26.600000
 up by the minute. I know, I know. My daughter does. My daughter's got two children and she

11
0:02:26.600000-->0:02:35.480000
 won't use her tumble dryer. Oh yeah, I've got two grandchildren, a newborn, three weeks

12
0:02:35.480000-->0:02:46.540000
 old and my other granddaughter is just coming up to three. Yeah. No, I know. I was over

13
0:02:46.540000-->0:02:56.110000
 there yesterday and it was, there's washing everywhere. No, she's got the clothes horses

14
0:02:56.270000-->0:03:09.800000
 and she just puts them in front of the radiators. The mould is really bad. Yeah. We were talking

15
0:03:09.800000-->0:03:14.360000
 about that yesterday actually. I'm trying to get her to change her mind, but she's very,

16
0:03:14.360000-->0:03:29.710000
 she's very environmentally friendly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Totally agree with that. She

17
0:03:29.710000-->0:03:44.920000
 has the doors open and the windows open. Honestly, I'm the same and I get nagged about it all the

18
0:03:44.920000-->0:03:49.780000
 time, but sometimes you just think there needs to be bigger things happening for my small

19
0:03:49.780000-->0:04:04.010000
 contribution to make a difference. Definitely. It was nice to meet you. Have a good afternoon. Bye.
