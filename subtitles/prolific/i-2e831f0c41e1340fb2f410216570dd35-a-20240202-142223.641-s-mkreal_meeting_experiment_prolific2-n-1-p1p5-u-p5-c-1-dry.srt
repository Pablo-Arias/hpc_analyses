 Hi. I'm good, thank you. I'm just going to turn the sound up a little bit. I can't.

1
0:00:21.950000-->0:00:24.590000
 That's great, thank you. Yeah, how are you today?

2
0:00:30.500000-->0:00:35.360000
 Yeah, not too bad, thank you. Looking forward to the weekend and just chilling out. I've got

3
0:00:35.360000-->0:00:55.240000
 some friends coming over, so. Have you got any plans for the weekend? Yeah. I think sometimes

4
0:00:55.240000-->0:01:10.050000
 it's really nice just to have no plans, isn't it? And no expectations. Yeah, yeah. What do you do?

5
0:01:16.100000-->0:01:25.200000
 Yeah. I'm a counsellor, as in the therapeutic one rather than a political one.

6
0:01:25.200000-->0:01:35.370000
 Yeah, I do. It's very sort of fulfilling, really. It's hard going. It can be quite gruelling,

7
0:01:35.670000-->0:01:44.980000
 but you know, I only work part-time now, so it's manageable. Where are you based?

8
0:01:47.850000-->0:02:00.050000
 I'm in Leeds, yeah. I came to Leeds to university in 1989 and I've stayed,

9
0:02:00.050000-->0:02:06.360000
 you know, just never went back. I think it, the thing for me is that we've got the best of both

10
0:02:06.360000-->0:02:09.880000
 worlds, so we've got all the city centre stuff and the convenience of that, but then, you know,

11
0:02:09.880000-->0:02:15.340000
 20 minutes the other way and we're in, you know, the Dales and beautiful countryside, so it really

12
0:02:15.340000-->0:02:22.540000
 is, you know, you've got a great balance of the convenience and the countryside as well, so yes.

13
0:02:23-->0:02:53.390000
 Have you always been living in the Dales? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, I always, I've got some

14
0:02:53.390000-->0:02:58.610000
 friends who live in quite a remote area in the Dales and, you know, when I go it's absolutely

15
0:02:58.610000-->0:03:05.110000
 idyllic, it's lovely, but then after a week I'm thinking, yeah, I'm ready not to have to

16
0:03:05.110000-->0:03:15.370000
 drive 25 minutes to go and get a pint of milk, you know. Yeah, yeah, I have the dream that that

17
0:03:15.370000-->0:03:21.250000
 would be an ideal place to live, but on the other hand I don't think it would because I'm disabled

18
0:03:21.250000-->0:03:28.630000
 as well, so I'm sort of reliant on, like, convenience and you just don't get out in the sticks, so

19
0:03:28.970000-->0:03:44.720000
 yeah. Yeah, I think it depends on your life stage, isn't it, and where you're at and what you want

20
0:03:44.720000-->0:03:52.820000
 and I'm single, so I think I'd feel quite isolated out there, whereas, you know, my friends, you know,

21
0:03:52.820000-->0:03:57.920000
 they've got a camper van and they just go off together and, oh, we end in 15 seconds.

22
0:04:00.390000-->0:04:09.820000
 Yeah, and you. Yeah, the same for you, even with no plans, great weekend. Yeah, okay.
