0:00:03.400000-->0:00:14.610000
 Hello. Can you hear me OK?

1
0:00:14.610000-->0:00:19.910000
 Oh good. Yeah, that's the last lady I spoke to.

2
0:00:19.910000-->0:00:22.330000
 It was awful. It was just crackling all the time.

3
0:00:22.330000-->0:00:24.130000
 I don't think she even knew I was there.

4
0:00:24.130000-->0:00:26.390000
 It was very difficult.

5
0:00:26.390000-->0:00:28.990000
 Oh dear.

6
0:00:28.990000-->0:00:31.720000
 Are you a student?

7
0:00:31.720000-->0:00:35.860000
 What are you studying?

8
0:00:35.860000-->0:00:41.670000
 Ah. I just guessed.

9
0:00:41.670000-->0:00:46.720000
 What do you want to do?

10
0:00:47.990000-->0:00:57.270000
 Oh. Yeah.

11
0:01:00.400000-->0:01:01.040000
 Oh right.

12
0:01:01.100000-->0:01:04.800000
 Would you go on to do the next one?

13
0:01:04.800000-->0:01:06.400000
 Is it a doctorate or something?

14
0:01:20.680000-->0:01:20.820000
 Why?

15
0:01:21.300000-->0:01:29.290000
 Oh.

16
0:01:29.550000-->0:01:33.690000
 Yeah.

17
0:01:39.220000-->0:01:39.760000
 Yeah.

18
0:01:42-->0:01:46.660000
 It's funny because my son, he's done his really much later in life.

19
0:01:46.660000-->0:01:52.980000
 He's in his late thirties when he did his and he was going to go on to do that.

20
0:01:52.980000-->0:01:55.180000
 But then he said it's just too much work.

21
0:01:55.180000-->0:02:01.880000
 All those years he's done studying and then to add another three or whatever on, it's just too much.

22
0:02:01.880000-->0:02:04.520000
 It interferes with your home life too much, doesn't it?

23
0:02:17.360000-->0:02:17.880000
 Really?

24
0:02:21.210000-->0:02:21.530000
 Yeah.

25
0:02:21.530000-->0:02:22.670000
 Oh, it's interesting.

26
0:02:22.670000-->0:02:23.110000
 Yeah.

27
0:02:23.950000-->0:02:24.170000
 Cool.

28
0:02:27.010000-->0:02:27.570000
 I'm retired.

29
0:02:27.570000-->0:02:29.690000
 I took retirement last year.

30
0:02:30.150000-->0:02:31.530000
 So, yeah.

31
0:02:32.270000-->0:02:32.570000
 Yeah.

32
0:02:33.590000-->0:02:34.450000
 I love it.

33
0:02:34.450000-->0:02:36.290000
 I mean, to be honest, it's nice.

34
0:02:36.290000-->0:02:41.220000
 I mean, you can do what you want when you want, eat what you want when you want.

35
0:02:41.900000-->0:02:44.580000
 And holidays, it doesn't restrict you.

36
0:02:44.580000-->0:02:49.320000
 We like traveling, my husband and I, and we've never been able to holiday in the winter.

37
0:02:49.320000-->0:02:53.280000
 And next month we're doing a winter holiday.

38
0:02:53.280000-->0:02:58.920000
 We're going to Norway and we're going reindeer sledging and husky sledging.

39
0:02:58.920000-->0:03:02.120000
 We're going to see the Northern Lights and we're going to the Ice Hotel.

40
0:03:02.120000-->0:03:04.100000
 You know, all things we couldn't do.

41
0:03:04.100000-->0:03:06.760000
 So, we're sort of ticking off a bucket list now.

42
0:03:06.900000-->0:03:07.740000
 Yeah.

43
0:03:14.200000-->0:03:15.560000
 We've traveled a lot.

44
0:03:15.560000-->0:03:21.180000
 I mean, I don't know really, but that's the main place, you know, on the list.

45
0:03:22.740000-->0:03:25.100000
 I'd like to go to Japan maybe one day.

46
0:03:25.200000-->0:03:27.660000
 But, yeah.

47
0:03:28.200000-->0:03:30.340000
 I've been to the Far East.

48
0:03:32.550000-->0:03:32.870000
 Yeah.

49
0:03:32.950000-->0:03:39.170000
 Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong.

50
0:03:39.170000-->0:03:40.490000
 Yeah, that was lovely.

51
0:03:40.490000-->0:03:41.010000
 It was an experience.

52
0:03:41.010000-->0:03:43.310000
 Go if you get the chance.

53
0:03:43.310000-->0:03:44.110000
 Yeah.

54
0:03:46.050000-->0:03:47.430000
 Do you plan on traveling?

55
0:03:48.860000-->0:03:49.260000
 Hmm.

56
0:03:57.550000-->0:03:58.710000
 Oh, no.

57
0:04:00-->0:04:00.540000
 Yeah.

58
0:04:05.450000-->0:04:06.830000
 Yeah, I do.

59
0:04:07.450000-->0:04:09.730000
 But it's going to finish in 15 days.
