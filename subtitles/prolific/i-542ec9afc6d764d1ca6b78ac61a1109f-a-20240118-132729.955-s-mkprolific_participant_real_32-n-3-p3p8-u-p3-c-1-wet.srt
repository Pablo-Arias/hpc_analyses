 Hi, hello, good afternoon. I'm fine, how are you?

1
0:00:22.700000-->0:00:25.580000
 We are very good, very strange.

2
0:00:25.700000-->0:00:30.710000
 So, what's your name? My name is Desire, by the way.

3
0:00:34.790000-->0:00:37.070000
 Oh, Amy, okay, nice to meet you.

4
0:00:37.850000-->0:00:39.880000
 So, what do you do for fun, Amy?

5
0:00:41.150000-->0:00:49.080000
 Oh, actually, I'm from Nigeria, but I live in the UK currently.

6
0:00:49.300000-->0:00:59.990000
 Okay, that's fine. So, what do you do for fun?

7
0:01:03.300000-->0:01:11.440000
 Two years or two months.

8
0:01:14.650000-->0:01:16.330000
 Oh, okay, he's past puppy level.

9
0:01:29.140000-->0:01:32.240000
 I think I'll say I like reading.

10
0:01:32.240000-->0:01:34.660000
 I like reading a lot of romance books.

11
0:01:34.660000-->0:01:36.860000
 So, like, I'm a romance freak.

12
0:01:36.860000-->0:01:41.620000
 I love the idea of finding your soulmate and just living happily ever after.

13
0:01:41.620000-->0:01:43.140000
 So, I read a lot of books.

14
0:01:43.140000-->0:01:45.060000
 That's what I like doing in my pastime.

15
0:01:45.100000-->0:01:47.080000
 I can watch movies.

16
0:01:47.100000-->0:01:50.740000
 I like the whole day just seeing different kinds of movies.

17
0:01:50.740000-->0:01:51.640000
 So, yeah.

18
0:01:52.910000-->0:01:54.390000
 Would I say I'm outgoing?

19
0:01:54.390000-->0:01:59.540000
 Maybe a bit, though, but sometimes I get tired of the crowds.

20
0:01:59.540000-->0:02:01.400000
 Like, just being in a crowded setting.

21
0:02:01.400000-->0:02:03.620000
 I just want to just space out.

22
0:02:09-->0:02:16.900000
 Yeah, and do other things with your time.

23
0:02:16.900000-->0:02:19.800000
 So, are you like a student?

24
0:02:33.040000-->0:02:35.360000
 Yeah, that's nice. What are you studying?

25
0:02:47.460000-->0:02:48.740000
 That same line?

26
0:02:49.620000-->0:02:50.220000
 Yeah, okay.

27
0:02:50.220000-->0:02:52.560000
 Oh, being a teacher. How is that?

28
0:03:14.120000-->0:03:16.900000
 Okay, so you want something with more...

29
0:03:17.390000-->0:03:21.110000
 Okay, I just finished my BSc Financial Management Technology.

30
0:03:21.110000-->0:03:22.590000
 I'm hoping to do my Master's.

31
0:03:22.590000-->0:03:27.030000
 So, I'm just working outside to gather some money now so I can do my Master's.

32
0:03:34.240000-->0:03:36.880000
 Yeah, me too. Hopefully soon.

33
0:03:36.880000-->0:03:44.650000
 Alright, so you're looking for something that will give you a more better work-life balance, yeah?

34
0:04:02.340000-->0:04:03.400000
 Yeah, true, true.

35
0:04:03.400000-->0:04:06.330000
 My mom is a teacher, though.

36
0:04:06.610000-->0:04:07.770000
 Yes, nice to meet you.

37
0:04:07.770000-->0:04:08.470000
 Bye.
