 Hi. Hi. I'm Chris. It's good to meet you. I'm from Scotland. Oh, you're from Canada.

1
0:00:37.450000-->0:00:50.440000
 Really? May I ask what brought you to Manchester? Ah, that's a very good reason. Now, um, where

2
0:00:50.440000-->0:01:21.740000
 did you meet your husband? Online. Yeah? Ah. Do you miss Canada? Ah. Yeah. Ah. It must

3
0:01:21.740000-->0:01:28.920000
 be difficult, um, being in a completely different country. Have you been made welcome in Manchester?

4
0:01:29.200000-->0:02:00.970000
 Yeah. Oh, then I'm glad to hear that. Now, this is interesting because although I was

5
0:02:00.970000-->0:02:10.330000
 born and brought up in Scotland, um, I, I, before retirement, I was a nurse and I did

6
0:02:10.330000-->0:02:21.210000
 a one, one year academic course in Manchester and I, I, I stayed, um, for that academic

7
0:02:21.210000-->0:02:34.850000
 year, I stayed in Didsbury and, oh, is it? Um, I lived, I lived at the edge of, in Didsbury,

8
0:02:34.850000-->0:02:46.030000
 but very close to Withington. Yeah. I've never, I loved it. I thought Manchester was very

9
0:02:46.030000-->0:02:55.800000
 much like Glasgow and I, I, I've never managed to go back to Manchester, but I have very

10
0:02:55.800000-->0:03:03.820000
 happy memories of being a student there. It, it, it, it, it, it, it was a great place to

11
0:03:03.820000-->0:03:26.910000
 study. Are you working? Oh, I hope you're successful. Um, sorry? What did you say? Oh,

12
0:03:27.050000-->0:03:40.480000
 it's the best thing. At my age, it's perfect because I have time. Sorry? No, not at all.

13
0:03:40.700000-->0:03:50.760000
 Um, I see family and friends. Um, I am happy where I live. Um, I go to a church locally

14
0:03:50.760000-->0:03:59.420000
 and have lots, lots of friends there and in the community where I live. I, I'm very

15
0:03:59.420000-->0:04:09.730000
 happy in retirement. I, yeah, but I do hope you have, have success with your job interview.
