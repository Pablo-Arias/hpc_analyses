 I'm from Canada. I got married and I moved to Manchester. I live currently in Salford

1
0:00:54.850000-->0:01:02.530000
 like M3 I think, yeah. So just outside, my husband works St. Peter's Square if you know

2
0:01:02.530000-->0:01:13.260000
 where that is. Everything's really walkable here so it's really nice. I'm liking it, yeah

3
0:01:13.260000-->0:01:27.440000
 Manchester specifically is great. I love how lively the city is. What made you want to

4
0:01:27.440000-->0:02:00.850000
 stay in Leeds? Yeah, oh that's so funny, that's my husband's favourite team. He's always

5
0:02:00.850000-->0:02:31.070000
 the man who gets all the hype of Man City's better. It's a generational thing. Oh that's

6
0:02:31.070000-->0:02:41.110000
 so cute, you can always go back and be like this is a piece of my history. Oh that's well

7
0:02:41.110000-->0:02:50.690000
 cute. Not at the moment, I had quit my job at the end of November. I want to work in

8
0:02:50.690000-->0:02:57.070000
 accounting or finance and so now I'm looking for jobs in that. I took some time to go back

9
0:02:57.070000-->0:03:02.070000
 to Canada, see my family and now I have some interviews coming up next week so I'm looking

10
0:03:02.070000-->0:03:12.460000
 forward to that. Yeah, they're both within walking distance here which is great. What

11
0:03:12.460000-->0:03:59.270000
 about you? Do you have a job? Yeah. And has your health improved then since? Right. Well

12
0:03:59.270000-->0:04:08.260000
 I wish you the best as far as your health goes, I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you, appreciate

13
0:04:08.260000-->0:04:09.400000
 it, it was nice speaking to you.
