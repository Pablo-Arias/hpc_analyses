 Hi. Hi. I'm good, thank you. How are you? Oh my gosh, same. It's been such a long week.

1
0:00:23.500000-->0:00:49.530000
 I bet it's about to be over. Oh my gosh. Oh, I've been dropped off. Oh, that's annoying.

2
0:00:51.800000-->0:01:02.570000
 Oh, that's so annoying. Same. Like, I saw the little intro saying, oh, it's about how

3
0:01:02.570000-->0:01:31.310000
 people talk to each other, but I bet that's not the full story. Like, yeah. Like, just

4
0:01:31.310000-->0:01:35.330000
 making small talk with other people is like the whole point of the experiment. It's kind

5
0:01:35.330000-->0:01:50.450000
 of confusing. I'm just staring at each other the whole time. Oh my gosh, that'd be so awks.

6
0:01:54.450000-->0:01:59.530000
 Yeah, the people watching it back afterwards just being like, ah, yeah, that was a complete

7
0:01:59.530000-->0:02:27.690000
 fail. Did all your conversations go fine before this? One of my people dropped out. Oh, really?

8
0:02:47.300000-->0:02:55.480000
 Yeah. Honestly, I'm going to be resting, but also cleaning, because our landlord is having

9
0:02:55.480000-->0:03:02.540000
 to replace all the windows, so I need to deep clean the entire house, which is a pain. Yeah.

10
0:03:06.900000-->0:03:13.140000
 I live with my mother, actually, and we rent from a landlord. I've lived here all my life,

11
0:03:13.900000-->0:03:43.570000
 landlord. Easy. Do you have any plans? Your cat has her own plans. Yeah. My friend has

12
0:03:43.570000-->0:03:48.110000
 a cat. Yeah, every time she tells me about a cat, I'm like, wow, your cat really is the

13
0:03:48.110000-->0:04:07.870000
 queen of the house. She bonds it. What, you're just doing nothing and looking over you like,

14
0:04:07.870000-->0:04:09.270000
 what are you doing, actually?
