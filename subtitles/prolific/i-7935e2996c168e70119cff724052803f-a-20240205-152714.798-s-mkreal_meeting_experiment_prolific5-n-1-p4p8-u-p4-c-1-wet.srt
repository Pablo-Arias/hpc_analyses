0
0:00:08.850000-->0:00:12.060000
 Yeah? Are you there?

1
0:00:13.600000-->0:00:14.860000
 Can I make a call?

2
0:00:16.700000-->0:00:19.450000
 Yeah, I'm just putting on volume a bit.

3
0:00:19.450000-->0:00:21.330000
 I do have a problem with my right ear,

4
0:00:21.330000-->0:00:25.210000
 but I can't wear any headphones at the moment.

5
0:00:25.210000-->0:00:28.670000
 Anyway, whereabouts are you?

6
0:00:28.670000-->0:00:35.800000
 Yeah, where do you live?

7
0:00:36-->0:00:38.420000
 Sorry?

8
0:00:38.500000-->0:00:42.450000
 I said where...

9
0:00:43-->0:00:45.020000
 I live in North Wales.

10
0:00:45.020000-->0:00:46.400000
 Where do you live again?

11
0:00:46.700000-->0:00:53.340000
 Oh, Edinburgh. All right. Okay, cool.

12
0:00:53.600000-->0:00:56.740000
 You've not got the accent yet.

13
0:00:57.600000-->0:01:00.280000
 I'm not too bad, thank you.

14
0:01:00.600000-->0:01:03.240000
 Yeah, I've been to Edinburgh.

15
0:01:04.600000-->0:01:06.240000
 What do I do?

16
0:01:06.240000-->0:01:07.760000
 Did you say?

17
0:01:09-->0:01:12.660000
 Well, I've got health problems,

18
0:01:12.660000-->0:01:14.240000
 so I don't have a job at the moment.

19
0:01:14.900000-->0:01:16.480000
 What about you?

20
0:01:17.450000-->0:01:18.990000
 What do you do?

21
0:01:21.900000-->0:01:23.230000
 Oh, right. Okay.

22
0:01:23.650000-->0:01:25.870000
 So, what...

23
0:01:27.950000-->0:01:30.110000
 Yeah, oh, right. Okay, cool.

24
0:01:30.150000-->0:01:33.390000
 So, what level are you in?

25
0:01:33.390000-->0:01:34.550000
 What...

26
0:01:35.150000-->0:01:38.170000
 Like, which year are you in?

27
0:01:40.250000-->0:01:41
 Sorry?

28
0:01:44.590000-->0:01:45.630000
 Oh, right. Okay.

29
0:01:46.150000-->0:01:50.650000
 Oh, right. That's interesting.

30
0:01:51.770000-->0:01:52.150000
 Yeah.

31
0:01:53.700000-->0:01:57.700000
 So, I'm originally from South Africa.

32
0:01:59.200000-->0:02:02.720000
 I moved over in 2008.

33
0:02:04.040000-->0:02:04.800000
 So...

34
0:02:06.600000-->0:02:09.260000
 Yeah, Johannesburg, actually.

35
0:02:11.180000-->0:02:12.340000
 Johannesburg?

36
0:02:16.350000-->0:02:17.810000
 In Gauteng.

37
0:02:17.810000-->0:02:19.390000
 Yeah.

38
0:02:19.950000-->0:02:24.470000
 So, we've been here about 15, 16 years now.

39
0:02:24.470000-->0:02:28.530000
 So, my parents went over to visit them,

40
0:02:28.530000-->0:02:30.350000
 and the rest of my family.

41
0:02:31.950000-->0:02:34.190000
 It's over this month.

42
0:02:34.190000-->0:02:36.410000
 And it was very, very hot.

43
0:02:36.410000-->0:02:39.730000
 They're actually in Cape Town now, near Cape Town.

44
0:02:39.730000-->0:02:41.190000
 And it was very hot.

45
0:02:41.190000-->0:02:43.830000
 So, I don't think I can handle that heat.

46
0:02:44.950000-->0:02:46.050000
 Yeah.

47
0:02:46.050000-->0:02:48.850000
 So, it must be quite different for you.

48
0:02:50.950000-->0:02:52.950000
 Different places.

49
0:02:55.500000-->0:02:56.300000
 Yeah.

50
0:02:58.500000-->0:02:59.640000
 Yeah, definitely.

51
0:03:01.700000-->0:03:02.320000
 Yeah.

52
0:03:04.820000-->0:03:06
 Yeah, definitely.

53
0:03:06.300000-->0:03:08.580000
 Anyway, that was our...

54
0:03:08.580000-->0:03:11.780000
 We decided we needed to move.

55
0:03:11.780000-->0:03:15.360000
 So, there were lots of different decisions.

56
0:03:15.700000-->0:03:19.380000
 So, when did you move over?

57
0:03:19.700000-->0:03:26.700000
 Where are you originally from?

58
0:03:31.350000-->0:03:33.100000
 Where were you born?

59
0:03:33.100000-->0:03:38.690000
 Yeah.

60
0:03:41.450000-->0:03:42.230000
 Nigeria, right, yeah.

61
0:03:42.900000-->0:03:45.470000
 I don't know very well, but I know the name.

62
0:03:46.450000-->0:03:48.750000
 So, when did you move over to the UK?

63
0:03:52.890000-->0:03:54.130000
 Three years, okay.

64
0:03:54.250000-->0:03:55.330000
 That's cool.

65
0:03:56.250000-->0:03:58.590000
 Have you got used to the weather yet?

66
0:04:02-->0:04:04
 Have you got used to the cold?
