 Hello, how are you?

1
0:00:18.200000-->0:00:20.750000
 I'm doing fine, thank you.

2
0:00:20.750000-->0:00:29.330000
 Just showered and I catched this study on Prolific and I was like, okay, this looks good.

3
0:00:29.650000-->0:00:31.190000
 Yes.

4
0:00:34.100000-->0:00:37.140000
 Where are you in the UK?

5
0:00:37.140000-->0:00:45.620000
 I'm in Brentwood, Essex.

6
0:00:47.850000-->0:00:50.370000
 How is the weather today?

7
0:01:00.330000-->0:01:00.350000
 Good.

8
0:01:08.660000-->0:01:10.660000
 Do you follow football? Do you like football?

9
0:01:12.720000-->0:01:12.840000
 Yes.

10
0:01:12.840000-->0:01:13.440000
 That's good.

11
0:01:17.220000-->0:01:18.300000
 What's your name?

12
0:01:20.520000-->0:01:21.120000
 Joanne.

13
0:01:21.800000-->0:01:23.520000
 My name is Iagoda.

14
0:01:25.210000-->0:01:29.150000
 I am originally from Macedonia.

15
0:01:31.350000-->0:01:35.240000
 Do you know where is it? Many people don't.

16
0:01:35.900000-->0:01:44.820000
 Yes, it is north of Greece. It's very small. Many people don't really know where it is.

17
0:01:46.750000-->0:01:59.900000
 I am here since 2017. I came here to do my master's degree and then got married here and I live here now.

18
0:02:03.150000-->0:02:10.420000
 Business Ecology. I did a master's degree in Business Ecology at the University of East London.

19
0:02:11.400000-->0:02:14.040000
 It was a really nice experience.

20
0:02:14.650000-->0:02:16.700000
 What do you do, Joanne?

21
0:02:35.100000-->0:02:39.500000
 Did you make a good choice then? Are you happy with your choice?

22
0:02:43.920000-->0:02:45.520000
 More free time, isn't it?

23
0:02:48.900000-->0:02:55.370000
 I've never been to Hampshire, to that part of the UK.

24
0:03:07.850000-->0:03:14.250000
 If the weather was nicer, it would be even better on the coast.

25
0:03:14.250000-->0:03:21.340000
 Are you a long time on Prolific?

26
0:03:25.780000-->0:03:25.800000
 Prolific?

27
0:03:25.800000-->0:03:26.400000
 Yes.

28
0:03:33.380000-->0:03:33.400000
 Okay.

29
0:03:33.780000-->0:03:34.260000
 Yes.

30
0:03:42.050000-->0:03:42.070000
 Exactly.

31
0:03:43.050000-->0:03:44.120000
 That's good.

32
0:03:49.600000-->0:04:04.440000
 Apart from doing certain jobs on different platforms, I started doing online sessions for people interested in coaching and personal development.

33
0:04:04.440000-->0:04:08.880000
 But I don't have many students or many clients.
