 Hello. I'm good, thank you. How are you? What's your name? Oh, whereabouts are you?

1
0:00:25.250000-->0:00:40.800000
 I'm in East Anglia. Oh, fantastic. Yes, I'm in Suffolk. Yes. Oh, lovely. Lovely. Oh, what

2
0:00:40.800000-->0:00:56.870000
 made you move? Oh, sorry. Oh, perfect. Oh, do you know what? So we moved here a couple

3
0:00:56.870000-->0:01:03.570000
 of years ago to originally from Gloucestershire, so other side, very wet, and then decided,

4
0:01:03.670000-->0:01:08.910000
 you know, pandemic, we wanted to be closer to family, so moved over. And it's lovely.

5
0:01:09.310000-->0:01:14.770000
 Really like it here. Completely different. But yeah, really nice. What about where you

6
0:01:14.770000-->0:01:49.100000
 are now? Oh, Cheshire is beautiful. Always prepared. Oh, do you get out a lot in the

7
0:01:49.100000-->0:02:16.360000
 Peak District then? Oh, I think that's it. I think that's it. And you know, it's really

8
0:02:16.360000-->0:02:20.960000
 hard, I think, at the moment, because obviously, going through something personally, and for

9
0:02:20.960000-->0:02:25.780000
 yourself, and then it must be quite challenging, you know, turning on the news, and there's

10
0:02:25.780000-->0:02:30.620000
 very rarely any good news at the minute these days, isn't there, in the world. So if you just

11
0:02:30.620000-->0:02:36.280000
 let that kind of negativity overwhelm you, then it's going to get you down, isn't it? So that's

12
0:02:36.280000-->0:03:15.980000
 a good way to think. Crikey, because I was going to say, I think her recovery period has been

13
0:03:15.980000-->0:03:19.780000
 estimated something quite significant, hasn't it? So you've obviously gone through some kind of

14
0:03:19.780000-->0:03:24.140000
 major, major surgery yourself, and that must have been really challenging. Have you ever had

15
0:03:24.140000-->0:03:49.170000
 surgery before? Or has this been your first time? And are you being supported by, you know,

16
0:03:49.170000-->0:04:06.870000
 physiotherapists in the hospital? Oh, oh, yeah. That's flying by. And I wish you all the best

17
0:04:06.870000-->0:04:09.810000
 for your recovery. Just take it easy, won't you?
