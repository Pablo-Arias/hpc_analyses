0:00:04.850000-->0:00:17.320000
 just as connecting oh hello hi can you hear me can you see oh good a lot of

1
0:00:17.320000-->0:00:24.580000
 technical problems as you're well this

2
0:00:26.180000-->0:00:34.570000
 I don't know what the issue is it's working anyway how are you you okay yeah

3
0:00:34.570000-->0:00:39.950000
 not bad where there's a bit rubbish but that's right you have a good weekend do

4
0:00:39.950000-->0:00:52.380000
 anything interesting I went up to see an old school friend it was a party so I

5
0:00:52.380000-->0:00:58
 had a really good time and it was a really good party for a long time but

6
0:00:58-->0:01:03.480000
 they know how to put a party and it was just a lot of fun yeah that was nice I

7
0:01:03.480000-->0:01:10.700000
 don't go to my party but it was a lot of fun and yeah they played loads of music

8
0:01:10.700000-->0:01:16.200000
 I've not heard for ages as well so it's just good memories kind of yeah it was

9
0:01:16.200000-->0:01:25.680000
 really good it's good tune where are you in the world all right but what

10
0:01:25.680000-->0:01:39.760000
 about in the UK there used to be the finance department I think used to be

11
0:01:39.760000-->0:01:47.530000
 just a little finance on them I'm in London near Ealing on the Ealing

12
0:01:47.530000-->0:01:53.870000
 Brentwood yeah but Roehampton what road from it's called but there's it's near

13
0:01:54.550000-->0:02:00.820000
 it's yes near the hospital isn't Queen Mary's hospital is that right the

14
0:02:00.820000-->0:02:07.310000
 hospital somewhere on there I can't remember I don't know it's Queen Mary's

15
0:02:07.310000-->0:02:16.580000
 but have you done many of these sort of experiments or whatever you've done lots

16
0:02:16.580000-->0:02:24.730000
 of hmm oh there's some really interesting stuff I mean not interesting

17
0:02:24.730000-->0:02:33.130000
 but there's some quite good fun yeah but a lot of it a lot of it is I've been

18
0:02:33.130000-->0:02:37.870000
 about less than a year but about eight months maybe a lot of them are now a

19
0:02:37.870000-->0:02:43.430000
 training AI so it's all about training AI to do things and like oh should I be

20
0:02:43.430000-->0:02:52.400000
 doing this I don't know if I want AI to take over everything I started last year

21
0:02:52.740000-->0:03:00.980000
 so I just do I know all the best ones get taken quickly about 10 people get

22
0:03:00.980000-->0:03:06.900000
 10 people 50 or whatever but this is an interesting one that is what it's a bit

23
0:03:06.900000-->0:03:11.460000
 more technical this one that's a problem I it took me a while to get on the first

24
0:03:11.460000-->0:03:16.560000
 person I couldn't he had a problem connecting the second person I didn't

25
0:03:16.560000-->0:03:18.520000
 see anything and so you actually the first
