 Hello. Hi. How are you? I'm Edwina. Hi Sue. I'm in the northwest of England in Cheshire.

1
0:00:27.730000-->0:00:48.100000
 Oh really? Gosh, what a coincidence because my boyfriend lives in Harrogate and his daughter's

2
0:00:48.100000-->0:00:54.620000
 in Leeds, so I was there at the weekend. So gosh, we're jet-setters, aren't we?

3
0:00:59.570000-->0:01:12.660000
 Wilmslow. Have you? Oh, what a small world. I know, I know. Yeah, yeah. And how are you

4
0:01:12.660000-->0:01:48.540000
 finding this prolific sort of experience? How did I get into it? I think during the

5
0:01:48.540000-->0:01:55.680000
 pandemic I was working from home and I was on my laptop a lot, and I just saw, I think

6
0:01:55.680000-->0:02:00.580000
 it was on a Martin Lewis thing, and I thought, oh, I'll give it a try. And so because I was

7
0:02:00.580000-->0:02:06.460000
 always on my laptop, I was always seeing surveys coming up. So I just decided to start, and

8
0:02:06.460000-->0:02:14.100000
 it's so, so interesting, sort of, you know, the broad sorts of subjects and the different

9
0:02:14.100000-->0:02:19.600000
 countries that are involved. It's fascinating, really, and you get paid for it as well. So

10
0:02:19.600000-->0:03:01.360000
 it's great, yeah? Yeah. That's really nice. Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is. You meet people

11
0:03:01.360000-->0:03:07.540000
 and you learn about subjects that you've got no knowledge of, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, I

12
0:03:07.540000-->0:03:20.150000
 think so too. Very much so. Yes, yeah. It's like, my son's 32 and he lives a couple of

13
0:03:20.150000-->0:03:25.390000
 hundred miles, he lives in Brighton, but it's like having a younger child. It's sort of,

14
0:03:25.650000-->0:03:33.590000
 it's like a teenager. It keeps you up to date, doesn't it, with things. So yeah, that's my

15
0:03:33.590000-->0:03:49.990000
 aim anyway. I'm 62 and counting down, not up. I'm a magistrate, so I do that part-time,

16
0:03:50.490000-->0:03:56.210000
 and I do a little bit of work, consultancy work, when I feel like it. It looks like our

17
0:03:56.210000-->0:04:03.710000
 time's up anyway, doesn't it? It's gone really quickly. It's been lovely meeting you. Yeah,

18
0:04:03.710000-->0:04:06.170000
 take care. Bye-bye. Bye.
