 Hello? I'm fine, can you hear me properly? Yes, I can. Can't see myself though, which

1
0:00:21.680000-->0:00:38.290000
 is a little strange. You can't see me? Oh, okay. This is a bit, this is interesting.

2
0:00:42.950000-->0:00:49.560000
 I am, I'm fine, just that I've got a bad leg, so I'm at home doing stuff instead of being

3
0:00:49.560000-->0:00:59.430000
 out. I'm not having a lot of fun. Yeah, but my leg really, really hurts. I'm like, oh

4
0:00:59.430000-->0:01:04.930000
 please, I would like to just go for a walk again without having to limp, but I'm getting

5
0:01:04.930000-->0:01:16.360000
 there. I think it's the cold as well, making it even worse. I twisted my ankle. It's a

6
0:01:16.360000-->0:01:24.290000
 long story and I've pulled my Achilles and I haven't been able to walk for weeks. Yeah.

7
0:01:31.500000-->0:01:41.040000
 Yeah. I've been resting for ages and well, I'm just waiting for it to heal. I'm hoping

8
0:01:41.100000-->0:01:45.720000
 because it's really calmed down a lot because before, like I would get out of bed, I would

9
0:01:45.720000-->0:01:56.800000
 step down and it's excruciating. Now it's not so bad. It's improving. Yeah, I have to.
