 Hi there. I'm okay, thank you. How are you? Good. Yes. Do you prefer Yasmina or Jasmine,

1
0:00:24.380000-->0:00:43.910000
 which yes. Oh, it's a beautiful name. My name's Leah. I think Leah, that's right. Yes. I get

2
0:00:44.930000-->0:00:51.690000
 a lot of people calling me Leah and Lee, but it's nothing like Yasmina. So whereabouts

3
0:00:51.690000-->0:01:02.160000
 are you, Yasmina? So I'm in Suffolk, so just up north from you. Yeah. So it's beautiful,

4
0:01:02.160000-->0:01:08.080000
 sunny here. Quite cold, obviously, but yeah, it's really nice. Do you like living in London?

5
0:01:16.960000-->0:01:48.520000
 Really? Oh, that's brilliant to hear, actually. Because I think as a country, we're quite

6
0:01:48.520000-->0:01:52.260000
 hard on ourselves, we're quite negative. And so we always hear kind of like, oh, it's not

7
0:01:52.260000-->0:01:55.480000
 good enough. But that's actually really good to hear, actually, that you can get around.

8
0:01:59.350000-->0:02:24.250000
 Wow. That's fantastic. That's fantastic. So apart from the weather, do you think there's

9
0:02:24.250000-->0:02:34.420000
 any other things that you miss? Where did you move from in 2016? Macedonia. I'm really sorry.

10
0:02:35.360000-->0:02:40.800000
 The only things I know about Macedonia are you take part in the Eurovision Song Contest,

11
0:02:40.880000-->0:02:45.760000
 which is really bad, isn't it? It's really bad. I should broaden my horizons. I'm sorry.

12
0:02:51.700000-->0:03:18.960000
 Mm-hmm. Tiny. Wow. Okay. And yes, yes, hence why it's so cold here. That's okay,

13
0:03:18.960000-->0:03:31.430000
 this is making sense now. Okay. Oh, and what made you move over here? Oh, fantastic. Wow.

14
0:03:31.430000-->0:03:58.650000
 What did you study? Oh, wow. Oh, amazing. Oh, that's fantastic. I'm so pleased.

15
0:04:03.030000-->0:04:09.070000
 No, sorry. I mean, I've moved all across the UK, really, for school and university.
