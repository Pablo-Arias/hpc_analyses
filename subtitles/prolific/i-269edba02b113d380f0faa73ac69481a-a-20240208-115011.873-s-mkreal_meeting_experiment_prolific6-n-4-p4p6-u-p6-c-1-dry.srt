0:00:12.150000-->0:00:12.790000
 How are you doing?

1
0:00:20.540000-->0:00:21.460000
 Okay, how are you doing?

2
0:00:24.990000-->0:00:26.690000
 Alright, so...

3
0:00:26.690000-->0:00:27.810000
 Can we get to know each other?

4
0:00:28.450000-->0:00:29.990000
 I'm Otto by name.

5
0:00:31.750000-->0:00:32.800000
 So...

6
0:00:35.620000-->0:00:36.440000
 I'm from Nigeria.

7
0:00:36.800000-->0:00:38.040000
 What about you?

8
0:00:41.200000-->0:00:42.020000
 Yeah.

9
0:00:43.300000-->0:00:43.840000
 How far?

10
0:00:45.850000-->0:00:47.230000
 Hahaha!

11
0:00:47.850000-->0:00:48.530000
 Hahaha!

12
0:00:52.830000-->0:00:52.850000
 Hahaha!

13
0:00:54.830000-->0:00:54.850000
 Hahaha!

14
0:00:54.990000-->0:00:55.250000
 Hahaha!

15
0:00:59.880000-->0:00:59.900000
 Hahaha!

16
0:00:59.900000-->0:01:00.300000
 Haha!

17
0:01:05.230000-->0:01:05.250000
 Haha!

18
0:01:07.230000-->0:01:07.250000
 Haha!

19
0:01:07.830000-->0:01:08.130000
 Hahaha!

20
0:01:08.250000-->0:01:08.850000
 Haha!

21
0:01:12.450000-->0:01:13.210000
 Hahaha!

22
0:01:17.430000-->0:01:17.450000
 Haha!

23
0:01:19.010000-->0:01:19.290000
 Hahaha!

24
0:01:23.130000-->0:01:23.150000
 Haha!

25
0:01:25.580000-->0:01:25.600000
 Haha!

26
0:01:27.580000-->0:01:27.600000
 Haha!

27
0:01:27.600000-->0:01:28.100000
 Hahaha!

28
0:01:28.600000-->0:01:34.250000
 I've been on it for like 8 months. This one is my own so, I've been on it for like 2 months.

29
0:01:43.820000-->0:01:46.260000
 Yeah, Sproxy I usually...

30
0:01:47.150000-->0:01:55.440000
 Yeah, there are certain things that I do. You know, the Sproxy, I don't really know the name.

31
0:01:56.200000-->0:02:00.180000
 It depends, usually that sends it for me, it refuses to give me that info.

32
0:02:00.200000-->0:02:03.020000
 So I just pay him and then he gives me.

33
0:02:03.200000-->0:02:06.600000
 But there's a trick I normally use. I will share this trick with you.

34
0:02:07.200000-->0:02:12.100000
 When you click on studies, it's usually full and you might not be able to do the study.

35
0:02:12.500000-->0:02:18.800000
 So you go to your Chrome extension browser and download this OP auto clicker.

36
0:02:21.800000-->0:02:28.800000
 So if you download the OP auto clicker and in situations where the study is full,

37
0:02:28.800000-->0:02:31.760000
 once you have uploaded it, if you keep on loading it with requests,

38
0:02:31.800000-->0:02:36.640000
 if you give it like maybe 5, 10, 20 minutes, it will finally accept you in.

39
0:02:36.640000-->0:02:40.780000
 So rather than you using your mouse to do that clicking option,

40
0:02:42.420000-->0:02:43.820000
 that's what the auto clicker will do for you.

41
0:02:43.820000-->0:02:49.280000
 So once you just move your mouse to the... yeah, it will keep clicking for you.

42
0:02:49.300000-->0:02:55.240000
 So if you just download it from your extension browser, the OP auto clicker,

43
0:02:55.300000-->0:03:01.520000
 once you just activate it, at any point you want to claim a study,

44
0:03:01.520000-->0:03:04.520000
 just alternate F1 and leave it on F10.

45
0:03:05.480000-->0:03:08.360000
 So it will keep on telling you study full, study full, study full,

46
0:03:08.500000-->0:03:10.840000
 until finally it opens the study for you.

47
0:03:11.600000-->0:03:14.440000
 The only disadvantage that...

48
0:03:14.980000-->0:03:19.400000
 The only study that I know that it poses a disadvantage is a study that is done by a research group.

49
0:03:19.600000-->0:03:25.580000
 Anybody that uses that research, you know, that lab, survey site, research something,

50
0:03:25.580000-->0:03:28.600000
 it always pushes people out.

51
0:03:28.600000-->0:03:33.160000
 Once this space is filled up, it will tell you that participants for you should return to study.

52
0:03:35.870000-->0:03:39.770000
 That particular platform that some researchers use,

53
0:03:41.310000-->0:03:42.770000
 that is the only advantage that OP clicker has.

54
0:03:42.770000-->0:03:46.690000
 Even if OP clicker will allow you to open the study, you cannot take the study.

55
0:03:46.750000-->0:03:51.690000
 But studies like quadrics and many other video studies, paviola and the rest,

56
0:03:52.150000-->0:03:53.350000
 you can actually do the study.

57
0:03:53.350000-->0:03:54.770000
 The OP clicker will help you.

58
0:03:54.770000-->0:03:57.730000
 Once you do it, you are free to go to study.

59
0:03:57.750000-->0:04:04.540000
 Me? I'm at Enugu now.
