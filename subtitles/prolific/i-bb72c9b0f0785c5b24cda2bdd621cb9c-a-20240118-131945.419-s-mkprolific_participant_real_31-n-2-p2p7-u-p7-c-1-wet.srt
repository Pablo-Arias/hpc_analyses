 Hello. Hi. I'm good, thank you. How are you?

1
0:00:24.750000-->0:00:28.110000
 My name is Faith. What's your name?

2
0:00:33.600000-->0:00:46.850000
 What? Okay. Okay. Hi. I live in Manchester.

3
0:00:46.950000-->0:00:54.120000
 Okay. Okay. Hello.

4
0:00:54.120000-->0:01:01.140000
 So, what do you do? I see lots of books, lots and lots of books behind you.

5
0:01:04.650000-->0:01:10.090000
 Okay. Okay. So, you travel a lot. That sounds like fun.

6
0:01:10.090000-->0:01:10.510000
 Where have you been?

7
0:01:21.200000-->0:01:26.030000
 Oh. Wow. That's awesome.

8
0:01:26.030000-->0:01:32.530000
 Is that like a career? Is that a career?

9
0:01:37.150000-->0:01:39.330000
 Like, is that your job?

10
0:01:42.400000-->0:01:51.320000
 Oh. Oh. I'm a student. I don't do anything cool like you do.

11
0:01:51.320000-->0:01:55.420000
 I don't travel like you. I'm a student at, you know, my sales app.

12
0:01:56-->0:02:05.210000
 Computer Sciences. Computer Sciences.

13
0:02:05.550000-->0:02:38.350000
 I've been studying for about six months. Six months, yeah.

14
0:02:38.850000-->0:02:46.490000
 It's not fun, but it's okay, I guess. It's okay.

15
0:02:47.910000-->0:02:52.450000
 Yes. A lot of hard work for me. A lot of hard work.

16
0:02:52.450000-->0:02:58.050000
 I'm actually overloaded with so much to do and so much to learn.

17
0:02:58.050000-->0:03:03.950000
 And it's, sometimes it's like, why did I start this? I don't even know.

18
0:03:03.950000-->0:03:09.290000
 But I'm getting there. I hope. I hope I can finish.

19
0:03:09.450000-->0:03:18.280000
 Well, I'm going to build applications.

20
0:03:18.280000-->0:03:21.740000
 Games. I want to build games.

21
0:03:21.740000-->0:03:27.940000
 Because I love games. I love the logic that goes on behind.

22
0:03:27.940000-->0:03:30.200000
 The algorithms that go on behind the games.

23
0:03:30.200000-->0:03:35.180000
 So when I play them, I'm thinking like, oh, I wonder what they did to make this action do that.

24
0:03:35.180000-->0:03:38.180000
 So that's what I'm going to do with my Masters.

25
0:03:38.180000-->0:03:40.200000
 That's why I'm studying so hard.

26
0:03:40.200000-->0:03:43.180000
 Because I want to do what they do.

27
0:03:43.180000-->0:03:50.240000
 And turn those drawings and characters into, you know, movements and cool sequences and stuff like that.

28
0:03:50.240000-->0:03:53.020000
 It's something I'm looking forward to doing.

29
0:03:53.020000-->0:03:56.200000
 Well, right now, I might not be able to do it.

30
0:03:56.200000-->0:03:58.940000
 But I can.

31
0:03:58.940000-->0:04:01.820000
 And our conversation is about to end.

32
0:04:01.820000-->0:04:04.260000
 Because it's so much.

33
0:04:05.540000-->0:04:07.220000
 It was lovely to meet you.

34
0:04:07.220000-->0:04:08.460000
 Thank you so much.
