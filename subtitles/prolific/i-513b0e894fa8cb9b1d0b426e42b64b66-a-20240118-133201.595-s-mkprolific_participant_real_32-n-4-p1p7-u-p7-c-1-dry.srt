4
0:00:46.090000-->0:00:57.680000
 yeah no it didn't did it I wonder if men just don't want to know yeah literally I

5
0:00:57.680000-->0:01:00.660000
 can't imagine men would be very good at this almost men would be very good at

6
0:01:00.660000-->0:01:14.870000
 this really whereas women are a bit more chatty aren't they yeah I was I was

7
0:01:14.870000-->0:01:17.870000
 thinking that when I just started the experiment I was like I hope everyone

8
0:01:17.870000-->0:01:22.490000

0:01:45.270000-->0:01:53.310000

12
0:01:53.310000-->0:02:01.700000

13
0:02:01.700000-->0:02:04.220000

14

 I'm from like Manchester area as well so we're just all around the UK then I

15
0:02:20.050000-->0:02:24.120000
 think a typical British thing we've all done is say how cold the weather is

16
0:02:24.120000-->0:02:29.640000
 which I think they'll probably pick up on I can't help myself I'm like oh it's

17
0:02:29.640000-->0:02:33.060000
 cold today isn't it it just comes naturally to me I think as an English

18
0:02:33.060000-->0:02:48.810000
 person you have to comment on the weather when you first meet someone she's

19
0:02:48.810000-->0:02:59.150000
 probably struggling then that's quite funny although I am freezing the woman

20
0:02:59.150000-->0:03:02.110000
