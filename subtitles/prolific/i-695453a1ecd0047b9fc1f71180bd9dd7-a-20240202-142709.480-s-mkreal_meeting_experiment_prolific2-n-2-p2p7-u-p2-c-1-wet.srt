 Hello. Hi, how are you? Yeah, good, good. Your accent sounds not far from mine. I'm

1
0:00:23.630000-->0:00:33.400000
 in the North West of England. Who are you? Well, I used to live in Suffolk, so sort of,

2
0:00:35.250000-->0:00:48.060000
 yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little place. Divorce. Divorce. Yeah. Yeah. So I moved back up Weryl

3
0:00:48.060000-->0:00:53.420000
 where all my support network is. Yeah. Yeah. But lovely part of the country, isn't it?

4
0:01:15.800000-->0:01:22.100000
 So I moved back to Wilmslow in Cheshire where all my family and my support network is. So

5
0:01:22.100000-->0:01:31.980000
 yeah. It is. It is. But it's quite wet and damp because of the Peak District. So I'd

6
0:01:31.980000-->0:01:39.640000
 forgotten how damp it was until I came back from Suffolk. So yes. Yeah. But, you know,

7
0:01:39.640000-->0:01:46.040000
 every day you take out your sunglasses, your umbrella and your gloves and you might need

8
0:01:46.040000-->0:01:55.780000
 any of them. Yes. Yes. Try to. Yeah, I try to. I've just come out of hospital. But before

9
0:01:55.780000-->0:02:00.700000
 I was in hospital, I was I was you know, I did a lot of walking. So hopefully I'll get

10
0:02:00.700000-->0:02:07.260000
 back to that soon. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's just one of those things, isn't it? Uphill

11
0:02:07.260000-->0:02:40.170000
 battle sometimes. And it's all about frame of mind, isn't it? And the Kate Middleton thing,

12
0:02:40.170000-->0:02:45.570000
 you know, all the all the discussion and the debate about what operation she's had. You know,

13
0:02:45.570000-->0:02:52.210000
 I've had an abdominal operation and she has too. So it's for some just coincidentally,

14
0:02:52.210000-->0:02:57.610000
 it's brought it to the forefront of everything. And there's all these sort of views, you know,

15
0:02:57.610000-->0:03:05.190000
 on on the media of like, you know, some of its facts, some of it isn't. And it makes me feel

16
0:03:05.190000-->0:03:10.710000
 worse. So I'm not even reading it. All I know is that she's got about twice as long as me to

17
0:03:10.710000-->0:03:32.670000
 recover. I've never had surgery. I've had a brain hemorrhage many years ago, but never surgery. So

18
0:03:32.670000-->0:03:40.290000
 yeah, but yeah, I thought I thought mind over matter would would do the trick. And it isn't

19
0:03:40.290000-->0:03:47.350000
 quite like that, unfortunately. But, you know, we just take each day as it comes. And, you know,

20
0:03:51.700000-->0:03:59.700000
 Oh, massively the hospital, the aftercare team, my GP and everything. It looks like we're going

21
0:03:59.700000-->0:04:05.140000
 to end fairly shortly. I could have talked to you for hours. It's been lovely meeting you.

22
0:04:05.140000-->0:04:09.090000
 Thank you. Yes.
