0:00:13.250000-->0:00:30.120000
 hello I'm all right not too bad a bit a bit of a mixed one really I like to go

1
0:00:30.120000-->0:00:36.200000
 for walks in the countryside I live quite rurally so I love going for things

2
0:00:36.200000-->0:00:41.740000
 like yeah well there you go I like I like hiking so that's what I tend to do

3
0:00:41.740000-->0:00:47.180000
 on a on a weekend is that do you have anything planned for yourself um I live

4
0:00:47.180000-->0:00:58.040000
 in I live in in Shropshire so I live in a place called the Clee Hills so it

5
0:00:58.040000-->0:01:03.940000
 tends to tailor itself for things like going for walks and that you get some

6
0:01:03.940000-->0:01:12.420000
 really stunning views so I tend to make the most of it what about yourself yes

7
0:01:12.420000-->0:01:24.260000
 yes yeah to be honest there I yeah I'd say they're exactly the same yeah they

8
0:01:24.260000-->0:01:28.940000
 say I yeah they to be honest when I moved here I was considering Devon

9
0:01:28.940000-->0:01:33.020000
 because they're not that I think oh this is a bit like Devon except it's not by

10
0:01:33.020000-->0:01:54.470000
 the sea so yeah yes oh well I'm one of these people I think because again I

11
0:01:54.470000-->0:01:59.690000
 have been to Devon a lot especially when I was growing up because again my I was

12
0:01:59.690000-->0:02:04.150000
 always very fond of it I love the coast because I used I grew up in in in rural

13
0:02:04.150000-->0:02:09.250000
 Ireland as well on the coast in a place called Kerry so I've always I've you

14
0:02:09.250000-->0:02:12.930000
 know I've always liked play you know seaside towns and things like that you

15
0:02:12.930000-->0:02:29.460000
 know so I am yes I'm studying IT at the moment well that's well that's the hope

16
0:02:29.460000-->0:02:34.560000
 anyway yeah it it's interesting again it's things like the coding and things

17
0:02:34.560000-->0:02:40.640000
 like that which again is the more of the skeleton side of it if that makes sense

18
0:02:41.260000-->0:02:47.400000
 so obviously I'm always you know it's it's it's quite a useful it's it should

19
0:02:47.400000-->0:02:52.440000
 it does help if also practices and that and I said lots of different things you

20
0:02:52.440000-->0:03:11.110000
 can apply to as you said so what about yourself have you yeah I was gonna say

21
0:03:11.110000-->0:03:15.350000
 you know I was gonna say you look too young to retired but this is it isn't it

22
0:03:15.350000-->0:03:19.470000
 well it's true but it but it's true isn't it I think you have to put your

23
0:03:19.470000-->0:03:46.500000
 health first I think what is it that you did really yeah yeah well I'm at it

24
0:03:46.500000-->0:03:50.920000
 I imagine it is I imagine you do it's it's it's it's on the go that's that's

25
0:03:50.920000-->0:03:57.530000
 amazing though you know sort of it's because again I I I love I mean I was

26
0:03:57.530000-->0:04:02.890000
 gonna I like cook himself but I could never do it commercially so I do I

27
