 Hi. Yeah, I can see you and hear you. Can you hear and see me? Yeah, me neither. Yeah,

1
0:00:28.180000-->0:00:34.460000
 I think it's just like, I guess they're kind of analysing like introducing you, I don't

2
0:00:34.460000-->0:00:44.330000
 know, like how you would meet someone. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'm based in London. I've been

3
0:00:44.330000-->0:00:52.630000
 here for like, 11, 12 years, I think. Yeah, what about you? Okay, cool. You don't sound

4
0:00:52.630000-->0:01:08.150000
 like you're from Manchester. American. All right. How long have you been living in Manchester

5
0:01:08.150000-->0:01:22.040000
 for? Oh, cool. Nice. You must like it, Adam. Yeah, it's really nice. I've got quite a few

6
0:01:22.040000-->0:01:28.720000
 friends who live up in Manchester, actually. Yeah, it's cool place. It's cool. Yeah, a

7
0:01:28.720000-->0:01:33.040000
 lot of my friends went to uni there. And so I would go up and visit them. And some people

8
0:01:33.040000-->0:01:39.060000
 who I used to work with live in Manchester. So I've been up for their wedding. Yeah, it's

9
0:01:39.060000-->0:01:45.540000
 cool place. And it's like, no, it's annoying. London, like, it's the only city in the area,

10
0:01:45.540000-->0:01:52.020000
 really. Whereas Manchester, I like that you've, I don't know, it's like a smaller town, but

11
0:01:52.020000-->0:01:55.140000
 it's so far from where I'm from that it wouldn't make any sense moving there. But I really

12
0:01:55.140000-->0:02:25
 like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, London's pretty bad for that. The other day, all the

13
0:02:25-->0:02:30.820000
 trains were cancelled. And I couldn't get into work. But I couldn't like drive my car

14
0:02:30.820000-->0:02:34.400000
 because you just can't drive into London. And I was like, it's only five miles away.

15
0:02:34.400000-->0:02:44.200000
 I can't even drive. Like, it's crazy. I just work from home. No choice. There's no choice.

16
0:02:44.200000-->0:02:49.840000
 Yeah. So yeah, London is very different. I suppose you get you get tired of it sometimes.

17
0:02:50.860000-->0:03:02.040000
 Yeah. Yeah. So what do you do? You're a student? Oh, cool. What kind of sales? Oh, nice. Okay.

18
0:03:02.180000-->0:03:13.150000
 I work in, like, politics advisory. Yeah, yeah, it's busy, busy time. Yeah, so it's

19
0:03:13.150000-->0:03:49.540000
 interesting. How did you get into sales? Oh, cool. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. Yeah.

20
0:03:49.540000-->0:04:09.060000
 Oh, where did you go? That sounds amazing. Oh, at the end. Oh, I'm so jealous. I'd love to have all the work.
