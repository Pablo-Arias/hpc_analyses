 Hello, I'm Chris.

1
0:00:13.980000-->0:00:18.810000
 Hello, Edwina.

2
0:00:18.810000-->0:00:20.310000
 I'm in Scotland.

3
0:00:24.490000-->0:00:24.510000
 Yeah.

4
0:00:24.690000-->0:00:26.310000
 South of Glasgow.

5
0:00:28.660000-->0:00:29.320000
 Where are you?

6
0:00:31.590000-->0:00:33.010000
 Well, cold enough.

7
0:00:37.610000-->0:00:38.930000
 Ah, right.

8
0:00:39.350000-->0:00:41.530000
 Now, I don't know

9
0:00:41.530000-->0:00:44.030000
 Wilmslow, but many years

10
0:00:44.030000-->0:00:45.930000
 ago as a student

11
0:00:45.930000-->0:00:48.050000
 I spent an academic year

12
0:00:48.050000-->0:00:49.170000
 in Manchester.

13
0:00:49.350000-->0:00:50.530000
 So that's

14
0:00:51.350000-->0:00:52.610000
 not too far.

15
0:00:55.050000-->0:00:56.270000
 It's at 12 miles.

16
0:00:56.270000-->0:00:56.890000
 Yeah.

17
0:00:57.650000-->0:00:59.830000
 But I was only there for one year,

18
0:00:59.830000-->0:01:01.130000
 but I enjoyed it.

19
0:01:12.920000-->0:01:13.780000
 Right.

20
0:01:18.300000-->0:01:19.980000
 Yeah.

21
0:01:20.300000-->0:01:21.640000
 I think we're

22
0:01:22.300000-->0:01:24.500000
 generally quite

23
0:01:24.500000-->0:01:26.460000
 welcoming, but

24
0:01:26.460000-->0:01:28.120000
 I hope you felt

25
0:01:28.300000-->0:01:29.680000
 welcome there.

26
0:01:39-->0:01:41.560000
 Yes. I think they call it

27
0:01:41.560000-->0:01:43.380000
 inner city regeneration.

28
0:01:45.150000-->0:01:47.270000
 Lots of new buildings,

29
0:01:47.270000-->0:01:48.290000
 new offices,

30
0:01:49.430000-->0:01:50.890000
 many, many

31
0:01:51.150000-->0:01:53.670000
 new blocks

32
0:01:53.670000-->0:01:54.470000
 of flats.

33
0:01:55.450000-->0:01:57.550000
 Some are owned and some are rented.

34
0:01:59.150000-->0:02:01.510000
 I don't go to Glasgow every

35
0:02:01.510000-->0:02:03.190000
 week, but I go quite regularly.

36
0:02:06.180000-->0:02:06.200000
 So

37
0:02:06.200000-->0:02:08
 how's life in Wilmslow?

38
0:02:08-->0:02:26.860000
 Ah.

39
0:02:37.750000-->0:02:38.600000
 Ah.

40
0:02:49.200000-->0:02:53.200000
 I hope you make a really

41
0:02:53.200000-->0:02:54.520000
 good recovery.

42
0:03:20.130000-->0:03:20.150000
 Yeah.

43
0:03:20.370000-->0:03:20.670000
 Yeah.

44
0:03:25.450000-->0:03:33.980000
 Yeah.

45
0:03:46.640000-->0:03:47.180000
 Good.

46
0:03:57.630000-->0:03:58.570000
 Oh, it's been

47
0:03:58.570000-->0:04:00.410000
 lovely to meet you. I used to be a nurse

48
0:04:00.410000-->0:04:02.370000
 and I think you'd be a great patient.

49
0:04:06.610000-->0:04:06.790000
 Bye.

50
0:04:09.430000-->0:04:09.570000
 Bye.
