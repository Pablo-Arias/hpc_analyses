0:00:08.050000-->0:00:23.800000
 Oh, hi. How are you? Good, I'm not bad. Where are you from? Oh, lovely. I'd like to go to

1
0:00:23.800000-->0:00:34.820000
 Brighton actually. Yeah. What's the weather like? Cold. Yeah. Yeah, it's the same, it's

2
0:00:34.820000-->0:00:39.760000
 cold, but the sun's came out so it's kind of heating up slightly. So it was like minus

3
0:00:39.760000-->0:00:46.480000
 six when we woke up this morning. So yeah, but the sun is helping a lot. So that's good.

4
0:00:46.840000-->0:00:55.130000
 Yeah. Yeah. Try not to put the heating on as well as much. That's bells are through

5
0:00:55.130000-->0:01:04.650000
 the roof, aren't they? It's ridiculous. So I know. I know. I know that's it because you're

6
0:01:04.650000-->0:01:07.370000
 stuck, can't you? Cause you're like, I need to do a washing. I need to put the heat on

7
0:01:07.370000-->0:01:14.210000
 to dry it or it's just going to stink of dampness. I know. Yeah, definitely. Uh-huh. Okay. That's

8
0:01:14.210000-->0:01:25.110000
 good. No, so you're like the fourth person I've spoke to, I think. Yeah. Right. Oh, is

9
0:01:25.110000-->0:01:31.350000
 it right? Okay. The first person that I had on, I couldn't hear like a word she was saying.

10
0:01:31.790000-->0:01:35.730000
 So I don't know if it was something to do with, I don't think it was to do with my mic

11
0:01:35.730000-->0:01:39.870000
 because everyone else I've been able to hear, but I couldn't hear a word and I felt really

12
0:01:39.870000-->0:01:46.330000
 bad, but she, and then next minute she completely froze and I was like, okay, I know she seemed

13
0:01:46.330000-->0:01:54.700000
 really sweet as well. So that was a shame, but yeah. Yeah. So do you work? Do you, are

14
0:01:54.700000-->0:02:10.940000
 you, do you work? Are you off today? Oh, brilliant. Wow. What on? Wow. Oh, that's fantastic.

15
0:02:11.360000-->0:02:17.980000
 Right. Right. Okay. Yeah. If you could give me any advice for an 11 year old with an attitude,

16
0:02:17.980000-->0:02:28.900000
 it would be more than helpful. I don't know. So she's a, yeah, she, we're just talking actually

17
0:02:28.900000-->0:02:33.720000
 that like a couple of girls before and she was, she didn't have any kids, but she was saying,

18
0:02:33.720000-->0:02:36.280000
 she was like, oh yeah, she's like, I've got nieces and they're like,

19
0:02:36.280000-->0:02:43
 attitude is so different to my nephews. And I'm like, yeah, that's, yeah, definitely.

20
0:02:43-->0:02:57.010000
 So how long have you been doing that then? Right. Oh, brilliant. Right. Okay. Oh, that's good.

21
0:02:57.710000-->0:03:02.170000
 Oh, that's really good. So you're, you're, you're doing more what you want with child

22
0:03:02.170000-->0:03:19.840000
 mental health thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My cousin is a teacher and from what I hear,

23
0:03:19.840000-->0:03:27.500000
 it is not easy. It's not easy going at all. So yeah, I can imagine. Yeah. She has quite a lot

24
0:03:27.500000-->0:03:32.900000
 of issues as well. So, um, yeah. And she's always tired and that's, that's the thing. She's,

25
0:03:32.900000-->0:03:37.820000
 she's like, I don't, she's like my hours aren't school hours. Like she's coming home at night and

26
0:03:37.820000-->0:03:42.800000
 marking and she's like, people don't see that. She says I'm sometime in the building at like

27
0:03:42.800000-->0:03:49.380000
 seven in the morning, you know? And I'm like, no, that's a lot. I had definitely. Yeah. Oh,

28
0:03:51.730000-->0:03:55.750000
 I work for a finance company. So yeah, I work from home,

29
0:03:55.750000-->0:03:59.850000
 which is quite handy. So I finished at one o'clock and then this came up. So

30
0:03:59.850000-->0:04:07.310000
 I know it was nice talking to you. I know you too. Bye. Bye-bye.
