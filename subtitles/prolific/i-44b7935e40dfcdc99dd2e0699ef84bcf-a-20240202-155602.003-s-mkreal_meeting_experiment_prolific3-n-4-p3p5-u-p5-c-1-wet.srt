 No. All I can hear is distortion in the background. I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Yeah, but there's

1
0:00:32.530000-->0:00:42.260000
 a lot of distortion in the background. It's kind of like, it's a weird noise per se. It

2
0:00:42.260000-->0:01:02.830000
 might be the headphones. It's the same distortion, that's pretty strange. I don't know. I think

3
0:01:02.830000-->0:01:10.060000
 maybe the headphones, it has some issues. Literally, there's a constant scratching.

4
0:01:16.800000-->0:01:30.010000
 I mean, I can hear your voice, but it's just the background noise is really loud. Don't

5
0:01:30.010000-->0:01:50.580000
 worry, we'll try our best. How many people did you have before? Oh, good, good. I've

6
0:01:50.580000-->0:01:58.680000
 had two people so far. None of us are sure what this experiment is about. We're not sure.

7
0:01:58.680000-->0:02:15.900000
 We're just like, what do they want people to do? Just sit and talk? Yeah, that's what

8
0:02:15.900000-->0:02:22.280000
 we were guessing. However, why not just tell us before? Just say, okay, this is what we

9
0:02:22.280000-->0:02:27.720000
 want to see, how should we interact? We didn't know anything. We're just kind of coming in

10
0:02:27.720000-->0:02:49.930000
 right away. What are we supposed to do? Huh? Maybe I did, because I was reading it, and

11
0:02:49.930000-->0:02:58.730000
 then I said, okay, that sounds good. But maybe I missed, because I skim read, because I'm

12
0:02:58.730000-->0:03:14.350000
 trying to do about two things at one time. So that's why I missed it. Are you doing anything

13
0:03:14.350000-->0:03:40.360000
 nice on the weekend? I work on Saturdays. I don't miss those days. I don't miss working

14
0:03:40.360000-->0:03:58.520000
 on Saturdays. No, I work from home. So I work completely remote. You'll get me. Just look

15
0:03:58.520000-->0:04:05
 up the fully remote jobs and hopefully you'll find one, because you can get what you want.
