2
0:00:37.010000-->0:00:52.780000

0:00:52.780000-->0:01:13.740000

4
0:01:13.740000-->0:01:21.380000

5
0:01:21.380000-->0:01:25.880000
 waiting for somebody to come and fix my tumble dryer so not very exciting but

6
0:01:25.880000-->0:01:40.710000
 these are the things to do how many people probably about five months six

7
0:01:41.030000-->0:01:47.090000
 yeah something like that it's quite good isn't it if you're at home I think it's

8
0:01:48.900000-->0:01:55.580000
 yeah I think I've earned quite well they can very true I've earned quite well

9
0:01:55.580000-->0:02:04.930000
 from it it's quite it's quite easy to do I think hmm I'll do I know what you mean

10
0:02:04.930000-->0:02:10.960000
 though but there's other sites that are a lot worse than prolific I think yeah

11
0:02:10.960000-->0:02:22.400000
 so that's quite useful do you use other sites as well yeah I think that's a good

12
0:02:22.400000-->0:02:32.440000
 plan I do some UX work so it's it's not really surveys or studies it's more

13
0:02:32.440000-->0:02:38.340000
 testing things I do some of that sometimes and quite a lot of live

14
0:02:38.340000-->0:02:43.200000
 conversations like this but they're quite well paid so it's worth me doing

15
0:02:43.200000-->0:02:50.460000
 it but not with prolific with different UX user experience so it's testing

16
0:02:50.460000-->0:02:55.900000
 things testing websites testing apps that sort of thing and that's that's got

17
0:02:55.900000-->0:02:59.900000
 I like that that's quite interesting and it's quite well paid as well so I can

18
0:02:59.900000-->0:03:09.230000
 fit it in around my other things that I do hmm yeah I like I like managing my

19
0:03:09.230000-->0:03:25.170000
 own time hmm yeah what about you and do you do anything else at all no okay

 okay all right okay are you at uni then okay what do you study oh nice

21
0:03:39.130000-->0:03:49.810000
