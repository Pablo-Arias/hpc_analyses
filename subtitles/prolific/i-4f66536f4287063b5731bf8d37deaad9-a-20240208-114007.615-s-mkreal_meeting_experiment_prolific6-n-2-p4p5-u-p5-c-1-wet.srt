 Hi. Such a weird, such a weird experiment, right? It's just like they're forcing us,

1
0:00:19.210000-->0:00:24.550000
 it's too early, I haven't had my breakfast yet and they're forcing me to be sociable to people.

2
0:00:42.850000-->0:00:49.030000
 Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's an interesting experience. You get to meet a lot of people.

3
0:00:49.030000-->0:00:56.650000
 I wonder, because I'm a psychologist myself, I wonder what exactly are they testing,

4
0:00:56.650000-->0:01:05.340000
 like what kind of, like how awkward is it or how, I don't know. I have a, I have, I have a,

5
0:01:06.260000-->0:01:12.700000
 there is one suspicious thing, I think that could be what they're testing, because can you see

6
0:01:12.700000-->0:01:20.590000
 yourself on a screen? I think that might be it, because it's, it's so weird, you know how you,

7
0:01:20.590000-->0:01:25.550000
 when you're like on Zoom calls or Teams calls, I can't focus on what people are saying, you just

8
0:01:25.550000-->0:01:31.620000
 keep on staring at yourself. And now I can't see myself, so the only thing I can do is actually

9
0:01:31.620000-->0:01:39.500000
 talk more to people. Yeah. Did you say it was your first experiment? Did you say it was your first

10
0:01:39.500000-->0:01:48.840000
 experiment? Did you say it was your first experiment? Of today or just in general on the website?

11
0:01:52.100000-->0:02:06.880000
 Oh wow, that's pretty cool. So you've just started with Prolific? Nice. I've been on it for a couple

12
0:02:06.880000-->0:02:13.320000
 of years. It's, it's, you get to do so many, yeah, you get to do so many crazy things on it. This is,

13
0:02:13.320000-->0:02:17.700000
 I mean, this is probably not the craziest I've done. There's so many, like there are some pretty

14
0:02:17.700000-->0:02:22.760000
 boring ones, you know, when you just do like a, when you just do like a questionnaire or something,

15
0:02:22.760000-->0:02:29.040000
 but there are, there are some like this, when you just like, they don't really explain much,

16
0:02:29.040000-->0:02:54.940000
 they're just like, here is a stranger, talk to a stranger. At least you don't,

17
0:02:55.820000-->0:02:59.660000
 at least you don't have to type things. I hate it when, you know, they're like,

18
0:02:59.660000-->0:03:07.900000
 please write, please write 500 words about how, and you just like, oh my God, can you not? And

19
0:03:07.900000-->0:03:13.090000
 then you just like, and then you're trying to add more water to it because you need to like

20
0:03:13.090000-->0:03:20.140000
 write a specific number of digits. And you're just like, oh my God, I really don't want to do

21
0:03:20.140000-->0:03:28.970000
 it. And with this, at least, you know, you just, you're just sitting here and yeah,

22
0:03:28.970000-->0:03:46.260000
 just chatting to people. It's a little better. Yeah. It's the evening where you are. It's a bit

23
0:03:46.260000-->0:04:00.230000
 dark. You like, you like being in the cave. Right. I see. It was very nice to meet you.
