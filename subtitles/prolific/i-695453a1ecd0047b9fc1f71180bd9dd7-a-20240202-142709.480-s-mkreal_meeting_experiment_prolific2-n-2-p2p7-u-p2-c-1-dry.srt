 Hello. Hi, how are you? Yeah, good, good. Your accent sounds not far from mine. I'm

1
0:00:23.630000-->0:00:33.400000
 in the North West of England. Who are you? Well, I used to live in Suffolk, so sort of,

2
0:00:33.400000-->0:00:47.200000
 yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A little place. Divorce. Divorce. Yeah, yeah. So I moved back

3
0:00:47.200000-->0:00:53.380000
 up where all my support network is. Yeah, yeah. But lovely part of the country, isn't it?

4
0:00:53.380000-->0:01:20.900000
 Yeah, yeah. So I moved back to Wilmslow in Cheshire where all my family and my support

5
0:01:20.900000-->0:01:30.360000
 network is. So, yeah. It is, it is, but it's quite wet and damp because of the Peak District. So,

6
0:01:30.360000-->0:01:39.640000
 I'd forgotten how damp it was until I came back from Suffolk. So, yes, yeah. But, you know,

7
0:01:39.640000-->0:01:46.300000
 every day you take out your sunglasses, your umbrella and your gloves and you might need any

8
0:01:46.300000-->0:01:56.200000
 of them. Yes, yes. Try to. Yeah, I try to. I've just come out of hospital, but before I was in

9
0:01:56.200000-->0:02:02.400000
 hospital, I was, you know, I did a lot of walking. So hopefully I'll get back to that soon. Yeah,

10
0:02:02.400000-->0:02:09.420000
 yeah. But yeah, it's just one of those things, isn't it? Uphill battle sometimes. And it's all

11
0:02:09.420000-->0:02:42.320000
 about frame of mind, isn't it? And the Kate Middleton thing, you know, all the discussion

12
0:02:42.320000-->0:02:48
 and the debate about what operation she's had. You know, I've had an abdominal operation and

13
0:02:48-->0:02:54.880000
 she has too. So it's just coincidentally, it's brought it to the forefront of everything. And

14
0:02:54.880000-->0:03:02.880000
 there's all these sort of views, you know, on the media of like, you know, some of it's facts,

15
0:03:02.880000-->0:03:08.320000
 some of it isn't. And it makes me feel worse. So I'm not even reading it. All I know is that

16
0:03:08.320000-->0:03:30.290000
 she's got about twice as long as me to recover. I've never had surgery. I've had a brain hemorrhage

17
0:03:30.290000-->0:03:38.170000
 many years ago, but never surgery. So yeah, but yeah, I thought I thought mind over matter would

18
0:03:38.170000-->0:03:45.070000
 would do the trick. And it isn't quite like that, unfortunately. But, you know, we just take each

19
0:03:45.070000-->0:03:58.480000
 day as it comes. And, you know, oh, massively the hospital, the aftercare team, my GP and everything.

20
0:03:58.480000-->0:04:03.900000
 It looks like we're going to end fairly shortly. I could have talked to you for hours. It's been

21
0:04:03.900000-->0:04:09.770000
 lovely meeting you. Thank you. Yeah, yeah.
