0:00:12.350000-->0:00:19.850000
 Hi, I'm good. Thank you. Can you hear me? Okay, so I just want to check

1
0:00:22.100000-->0:00:23.450000
 Yeah, I can hear you

2
0:00:27.100000-->0:00:40.660000
 I'm London. I lived here all my life was born here. What about you? I haven't

3
0:00:48.330000-->0:00:49.950000
 Why'd you say that?

4
0:00:58.640000-->0:01:02.480000
 Have us it's one of like the barbers on like the outer edge of it

5
0:01:03.660000-->0:01:06.500000
 Yeah, you know cowboys school and

6
0:01:08.110000-->0:01:12.010000
 Kind of yeah, it's an interesting area

7
0:01:15.750000-->0:01:16.030000
 Um

8
0:01:16.750000-->0:01:19.970000
 You have on the hill is like a really really nice area

9
0:01:19.970000-->0:01:24.930000
 So is pain up but then you kind of go to like real stone side and it was kind of the areas

10
0:01:24.930000-->0:01:28.070000
 You're told not to go alone growing. Yeah

11
0:01:34.950000-->0:01:34.970000
 Yeah

12
0:01:36.900000-->0:01:44.510000
 Yeah, it's kind of weird you walk like 20 minutes in Harrow and you end up yeah, so I'm a completely different it honestly is bizarre

13
0:01:55.660000-->0:02:01.220000
 Not like when I was growing up we didn't really go very often but um when I started university

14
0:02:01.220000-->0:02:07.980000
 I went to university in London. So it was really convenient. I could live a home and save on rent, which I was very grateful for

15
0:02:09.900000-->0:02:34.420000
 And have you been to London much I've always wanted to visit more places in the UK

16
0:02:39.060000-->0:02:40.760000
 Same same

17
0:02:44.830000-->0:02:46.970000
 Yes, I'm doing my master's

18
0:02:46.970000-->0:02:48.370000
 last year

19
0:02:49.810000-->0:02:58.050000
 Classics, I'm nearly done with it. I just might like two or three more months of studying and then my dissertation and then I'm done

20
0:02:58.050000-->0:03:05.940000
 Thank God. Oh

21
0:03:05.940000-->0:03:13.600000
 That's that's a million dollar question, I wish I knew yeah, I'm a little terrified. I can't lie. I like in theory

22
0:03:14.080000-->0:03:20.800000
 Everyone says like oh, it's like a transferable degree. But then part of me feels like they're saying that to make you feel a bit better

23
0:03:22.160000-->0:03:35.460000
 That's true, that's true. I'm like fingers crossed it goes smoothly. Oh, no, that's fine

24
0:03:40.750000-->0:03:49.270000
 Honestly, absolutely like don't blame me people say university is like the be-all end-all like kind of the route everyone should go for but I really disagree

25
0:03:59.760000-->0:03:59.780000
 Yeah

26
0:03:59.780000-->0:04:08.680000
 It was nice talking to you. Yeah, I didn't realize I was four minutes. I was really confused. Okay. Bye. Bye
