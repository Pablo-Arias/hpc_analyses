 Hello. Hiya, how are you? Is that better? Yeah, not bad. I can't complain, it's Friday, so you know, that's nice. How about you? Good. Yeah, definitely. Oh, nice.

1
0:00:38.650000-->0:00:49.210000
 I don't. To be fair, actually, it's quite relaxed. I think I'll probably just relax, catch up on a bit of life admin and, you know, watch some TV, maybe go see some family. That's it, really.

2
0:00:49.210000-->0:01:06.270000
 So fairly relaxed. It's nice having a chill weekend once in a while, I think. Yeah. Yeah. I think sometimes I feel like I'm just a headless chicken running around, so it's nice just to not have that as well.

3
0:01:06.270000-->0:01:34.870000
 So it's good. Yeah. I work for a telecoms company, working in their commercial team. So that's what I do day to day. How about you? Oh, nice. Yeah. Fair enough. And do you enjoy that? Yeah. Yeah.

4
0:01:39.100000-->0:01:53.730000
 OK. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like a really interesting role. I'm based in the West Midlands. How about you? Oh, nice. I've been to Leeds before. It's a lovely place.

5
0:01:58.800000-->0:02:35.390000
 You must really like it then. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. We live kind of. Sorry. Yeah. I was going to say I've always lived in the Midlands and we kind of live in a bit of a suburban area, but you can get into the city centre like Birmingham within about half an hour.

6
0:02:35.390000-->0:03:25.610000
 But then the other side, you do get the countryside and you can go down towards like Worcester kind of way as well and get the Malvern Hills, which is quite nice. So I think it's nice having that mix. So you're not always, you know, in one too much. You can kind of pick and choose a little bit. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's a convenience, isn't it? Sometimes that does help. Yeah. Yeah.

7
0:03:25.610000-->0:04:01.660000
 No, I think it's probably one of those where you get used to it if you're there, but at the same time, it's you know, you don't get that convenience, which just adds more stress than you need, really. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that was quite good. Well, it was really nice to meet you and I hope you have a lovely weekend.

0:04:05-->0:04:06.980000
 And it'll be a nice relaxing one.
