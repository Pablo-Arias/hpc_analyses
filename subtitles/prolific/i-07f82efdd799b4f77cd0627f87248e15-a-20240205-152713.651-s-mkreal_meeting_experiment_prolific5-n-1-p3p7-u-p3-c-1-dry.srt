0:00:11.150000-->0:00:14.350000
 Hi, can you see me okay?

1
0:00:17.950000-->0:00:20.550000
 Yeah, it's weird because I can't see myself.

2
0:00:20.550000-->0:00:21.630000
 I'm like, at least you are.

3
0:00:22.650000-->0:00:25.970000
 So what do we actually have to do?

4
0:00:25.970000-->0:00:26.950000
 We have to just like chat.

5
0:00:37.850000-->0:00:41.290000
 So it sounds like you're based in the UK.

6
0:00:47.860000-->0:00:48.380000
 Oh nice.

7
0:00:48.800000-->0:00:50.400000
 I'm up in Manchester.

8
0:00:52.450000-->0:00:52.670000
 Yeah.

9
0:00:53.590000-->0:00:56.870000
 I know, I think I've got quite like a neutral accent.

10
0:00:57.350000-->0:00:59.790000
 Sometimes people are like, oh, are you American?

11
0:00:59.790000-->0:01:00.430000
 Are you German?

12
0:01:01.350000-->0:01:03.510000
 People never understand.

13
0:01:03.510000-->0:01:04.870000
 It's quite funny, to be honest.

14
0:01:08.930000-->0:01:10.190000
 Literally my whole life.

15
0:01:10.450000-->0:01:11.710000
 Born and raised.

16
0:01:11.710000-->0:01:13.290000
 Yeah, born and raised, yeah.

17
0:01:14.010000-->0:01:15.370000
 Yeah, yeah, it's good.

18
0:01:15.450000-->0:01:18.130000
 Sometimes you think about like, oh, should I move?

19
0:01:18.130000-->0:01:19.610000
 But then it's like, oh, my family's here.

20
0:01:19.610000-->0:01:21.030000
 And it's like, that's nice.

21
0:01:24.290000-->0:01:24.570000
 Yeah.

22
0:01:25.800000-->0:01:27.450000
 Have you been out in Manchester before?

23
0:01:38.840000-->0:01:39.300000
 How cute.

24
0:01:55.970000-->0:01:57.590000
 Yeah, it's so cute.

25
0:01:57.590000-->0:02:00.550000
 It's great, to be honest, because it's like different suburbs and stuff.

26
0:02:00.550000-->0:02:04.930000
 Like within Manchester, it's like a nice bit like a hipster park.

27
0:02:04.930000-->0:02:06.550000
 And then there's like where all the students are.

28
0:02:06.550000-->0:02:08.730000
 And then there's like, obviously the city centre.

29
0:02:08.730000-->0:02:10.450000
 But it's like all the different places.

30
0:02:10.450000-->0:02:12.050000
 There are restaurants and stuff.

31
0:02:12.250000-->0:02:17.090000
 But yeah, I prefer it because I can't live somewhere that you can't drive, I think.

32
0:02:17.090000-->0:02:18.330000
 Like, I don't know.

33
0:02:18.330000-->0:02:20.570000
 I don't think I could get public transport anywhere.

34
0:02:20.570000-->0:02:21.300000
 Yeah.

35
0:02:26.970000-->0:02:27.930000
 Oh, my God.

36
0:02:33.550000-->0:02:34.890000
 Oh, my God.

37
0:02:36.970000-->0:02:37.850000
 That's crazy.

38
0:02:37.850000-->0:02:39.470000
 So what did you do? You just had to get a taxi?

39
0:02:41.330000-->0:02:42.010000
 Oh, OK.

40
0:02:44.170000-->0:02:44.570000
 Yeah.

41
0:02:54.260000-->0:02:55.700000
 Oh, no, I work in sales.

42
0:02:57.350000-->0:02:57.670000
 Yeah.

43
0:02:58.730000-->0:02:59.730000
 Software sales.

44
0:02:59.730000-->0:03:01.230000
 So software consulting sales.

45
0:03:01.230000-->0:03:02.090000
 How about you?

46
0:03:06.250000-->0:03:07.870000
 Oh, that sounds interesting.

47
0:03:11-->0:03:11.710000
 Yeah.

48
0:03:16.050000-->0:03:18.810000
 Well, I actually like studied psychology, like initially.

49
0:03:19.510000-->0:03:20.710000
 And then did like psychology.

50
0:03:21.050000-->0:03:23.090000
 And then I did a master's like a couple of years later.

51
0:03:23.090000-->0:03:27.030000
 But then like in COVID, I literally worked in like a psychiatric hospital.

52
0:03:27.050000-->0:03:28.810000
 And it was like scarred me.

53
0:03:29.050000-->0:03:31.030000
 I was like, yeah, I'm not going into psychology.

54
0:03:31.050000-->0:03:33.270000
 And then sort of fell into sales.

55
0:03:33.270000-->0:03:35.090000
 But yeah, I love it.

56
0:03:35.090000-->0:03:35.750000
 It's so fun.

57
0:03:36.050000-->0:03:40.370000
 And I get to work with like really big companies and travel a lot.

58
0:03:40.370000-->0:03:45.530000
 Like last year, I went to like 16 countries, but like with work.

59
0:03:45.530000-->0:03:47.350000
 And then some of them was work.

60
0:03:47.350000-->0:03:48.770000
 But then some of them was like for fun.

61
0:03:49.070000-->0:03:51.190000
 So, yeah, I love that.

62
0:03:51.190000-->0:03:52.130000
 It's so fun.

63
0:03:54.700000-->0:03:56.310000
 Oh, I'm in my 50s.

64
0:03:56.450000-->0:04:07.790000
 I went to, I know, it was like Vietnam, Cambodia, Dubai, Istanbul, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Italy, all the places.
