 Hello. Hi. How are you? It's Julie. I don't think I can hear you very well. There is a

1
0:00:21.730000-->0:00:50.890000
 beeping sound in the background. That might be it. That's fantastic. I work and live in

2
0:00:50.890000-->0:01:09.890000
 London, but I moved from New York. Yes. Oh, I love it. Whereabouts are you studying? Oh,

3
0:01:09.890000-->0:01:41.740000
 okay. Nice. I've heard it's really lovely. Yes. Yeah. Oh, fantastic. Yeah. I will enjoy it.

4
0:01:41.760000-->0:01:48.410000
 Hopefully, it's really good weather and it's nice. Do you have a lot planned?

5
0:02:01.050000-->0:02:10.830000
 Yeah. Yeah. Is it related? Oh, I mean, like, it just depends what you're looking

6
0:02:11.910000-->0:02:29.740000
 to do. That's... I mean, it just depends what... Honestly, it just depends what you're interested

7
0:02:29.740000-->0:02:35.260000
 in. If you want to... If you like going on walks, there's a ton of really nice parks.

8
0:02:35.280000-->0:02:43.200000
 If you like more cultural things, the museums are all fantastic. They're all close to each other,

9
0:02:43.200000-->0:02:49.620000
 too, so it's quite easy to hop in and out. And the food is really delicious. So it's just...

10
0:02:49.620000-->0:02:54.540000
 I don't know. There's something for everything, depending on what you want to do.

11
0:02:57.560000-->0:03:06.450000
 Yeah. No, it was actually... I mean, it was much easier than New York. Have you been to New York?

12
0:03:08.850000-->0:03:20.750000
 So I recommend it. It's nice to experience. But the city is a lot calmer, in a way, than New York.

13
0:03:20.750000-->0:03:30.850000
 New York feels very busy and hectic. And just with the buildings all being so tall,

14
0:03:30.850000-->0:03:36.450000
 you feel so much smaller. And like, it's a little bit claustrophobic in some ways.

15
0:03:37.010000-->0:03:46.190000
 There's less green parks. So there's just... Yeah. Versus in London, like, I'm right between two

16
0:03:46.190000-->0:03:54.290000
 really big parks. So it's like 10 minutes away from me. So it's so convenient to just go out.

17
0:03:55.110000-->0:04:00.070000
 Versus in New York, it just feels more congested.

18
0:04:04.250000-->0:04:08.950000
 Yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy here. Well, I hope you enjoy your visit.
