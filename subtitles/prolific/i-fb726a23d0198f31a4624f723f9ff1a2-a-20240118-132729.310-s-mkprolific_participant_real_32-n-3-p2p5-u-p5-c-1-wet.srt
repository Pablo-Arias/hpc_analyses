0:00:10.050000-->0:00:19.650000
 Hello, hello. How are you? I'm alright. What's your name? Where are you from?

1
0:00:23.750000-->0:00:31.870000
 So I live in Exeter, my name is Annette. You're the second Scottish person I'm talking to today.

2
0:00:31.870000-->0:00:37.190000
 So the lady before was from Aberdeen, so I'm like travelling around Scotland.

3
0:00:37.190000-->0:00:43.190000
 The other lady was from Derbyshire, so yeah, I'm going up, sort of.

4
0:00:43.550000-->0:00:48.670000
 I'm the only person from the south, weirdly, I don't know why it's like that.

5
0:00:49.550000-->0:00:54.630000
 Okay, yeah, so also north, yeah.

6
0:00:59.100000-->0:01:05.320000
 I mean, minus two it was, I think. I don't know, it's six now, apparently,

7
0:01:05.320000-->0:01:08.780000
 because the sun has come out, so it got a lot warmer.

8
0:01:09.100000-->0:01:12.620000
 But yeah, at night it was quite cold. How is it up there?

9
0:01:19.400000-->0:01:39.480000
 Hmm, hmm, yeah, oh no, no, yeah, wow.

10
0:01:40.700000-->0:01:42.440000
 Yeah, no, it's not worth it.

11
0:01:42.440000-->0:01:47.140000
 Well done on you going on walks, that's really disciplined. I need to start doing that.

12
0:01:53.300000-->0:02:00.710000
 No, yeah, exactly. No, yeah.

13
0:02:05.040000-->0:02:08.700000
 So I work, yeah, so this is my lunch break now from one to two.

14
0:02:08.700000-->0:02:13.940000
 So I got a jingle from Porify, I was like, yeah, okay, why not, may as well.

15
0:02:20.750000-->0:02:31.280000
 Oh, wow, yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, may as well.

16
0:02:31.500000-->0:02:36.670000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17
0:02:37.070000-->0:02:41.050000
 It's like five pounds, that one as well, so five pounds good.

18
0:02:41.050000-->0:02:47.090000
 Yeah, I think so, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19
0:02:48.250000-->0:02:57.230000
 Sometimes I feel like I get a lot of like these 13p ones and like 20p ones and all of that.

20
0:02:57.230000-->0:03:04.230000
 And then I get a lot of like five, three, two, like it always like comes in this like lots for me.

21
0:03:04.230000-->0:03:05.530000
 I don't know why, it's weird.

22
0:03:06.250000-->0:03:09.570000
 Oh, we're not supposed to put our hands up, oh, I broke the rule.

23
0:03:11.250000-->0:03:11.750000
 Whoops.

24
0:03:20.550000-->0:03:26.070000
 Yeah, I know you like literally have to be on it, like on it, on it, it's crazy.

25
0:03:27.550000-->0:03:32.090000
 So irritating when you also get something like late at night and you're like, oh, I can't be bothered.

26
0:03:32.550000-->0:03:37.610000
 And I'm like, who the hell releases a survey at like 10pm in Germany?

27
0:03:37.610000-->0:03:40.470000
 And I'm like, what are you doing, guys? Who are you doing?

28
0:03:55.500000-->0:03:59.730000
 Yeah, like, yeah.

29
0:04:03.050000-->0:04:07.250000
 I'm being sad, but then three quid, so like, yeah.

30
0:04:08.050000-->0:04:09.130000
 Why not?
