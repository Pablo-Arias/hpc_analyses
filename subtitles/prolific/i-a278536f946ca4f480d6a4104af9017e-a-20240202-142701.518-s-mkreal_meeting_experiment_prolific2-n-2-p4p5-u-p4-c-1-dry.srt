 Hi, how are you? Good, thank you. My name is Jasmina. What's your name? Sue, nice to meet you.

1
0:00:31.480000-->0:00:51.550000
 Where are you from? Kenya. Sorry? Yes, yes, of course, yes. The sound is not the best

2
0:00:51.630000-->0:00:59.070000
 or the internet. Yes, I do. I do know where Liz is. I am living in London.

3
0:01:06.240000-->0:01:19.780000
 Can you please repeat, sorry? I'm working from home, actually. I'm offering a program,

4
0:01:20-->0:01:25.820000
 online sessions for people that are suffering anxiety and panic attacks.

5
0:01:26.840000-->0:01:35.340000
 So, yes, that's part of my engagement and also I'm doing online testings, etc.,

6
0:01:35.340000-->0:02:11.350000
 just to fill in the time. And how about you? Ah, okay. Yes, and how do you find that

7
0:02:11.350000-->0:02:37.670000
 you changed now to work remotely? Do you prefer that? Do you like it? Yes, exactly.

8
0:02:49.350000-->0:03:01.630000
 Ah, well, you mentioned that you are having a disability, yes? Yes, I am also, I'm a wheelchair

9
0:03:01.630000-->0:03:08.590000
 user and for me as well, it's much easier that I am working from home. So, definitely, it's

10
0:03:08.590000-->0:03:16.270000
 better than traveling. And especially in London, it's such a big and crowded city. If I need to

11
0:03:16.270000-->0:03:29.480000
 commute, that would be crazy on a daily basis. So, yes, I really like it. Yes, indeed. And tell

12
0:03:29.480000-->0:03:47.700000
 me, are you a wheelchair user or what disability do you have? Okay, and if you don't mind asking

13
0:03:47.700000-->0:04:09.730000
 what is your condition? Okay. Well, of course, of course, life goes on.
