0
0:00:18.960000-->0:00:24.200000
 I had a blank blank conversation because they just said that somebody dropped out

1
0:00:24.200000-->0:00:27.580000
 so I was just looking at a connected window and I was thinking I hope it's

2
0:00:27.580000-->0:00:46.860000
 not my laptop that's lost connection, oh well at least it's not us. How are you?

3
0:01:12.320000-->0:01:18.540000
 I feel your pain, I broke my leg last year and the physiotherapy afterwards it was like you say

4
0:01:18.540000-->0:01:24.040000
 it's the motivation so then just sort of like when you've been so immobile for so long and then

5
0:01:24.040000-->0:01:28.520000
 you know you kind of lose your motivation for most things don't you? But yeah I think

6
0:01:28.680000-->0:01:32.540000
 that was definitely the bit I struggled with is the physiotherapy afterwards.

7
0:01:40.550000-->0:01:45.040000
 Yeah oh you'll get there.

8
0:01:58.620000-->0:02:02.300000
 You just want normality now don't you then if you've been waiting such a long time.

9
0:02:02.300000-->0:02:05.180000
 Where are you located you guys since up north?

10
0:02:08.010000-->0:02:10.730000
 Oh no okay it's cold there today isn't it.

11
0:02:16.150000-->0:02:26.970000
 Oh oh no way oh I couldn't do that I could not it's bad enough I went to go and get the bins

12
0:02:26.970000-->0:02:32.470000
 in this morning and even now I was like oh god I'm not going out again today it's awful out there

13
0:02:32.470000-->0:02:43.810000
 but yeah it's all my stuff. No no I don't. How about yourself? Oh wow oh okay.

14
0:02:52.050000-->0:02:57.310000
 Oh I bet she gets protected by her brothers big brothers though doesn't she?

15
0:03:02.450000-->0:03:10.090000
 Yeah oh yeah it's like most well I think it's most households these days aren't they they're

16
0:03:10.090000-->0:03:14.990000
 all you know pretty much the same like yeah I'm saying come from a broken family so I think it

17
0:03:14.990000-->0:03:20.090000
 it was more normal to have a broken family than it was to not when I was in school so

18
0:03:21.630000-->0:03:23.650000
 common these days isn't it.

19
0:03:29.100000-->0:03:47.790000
 Oh how lucky on my hit list yeah yeah.

20
0:03:49.010000-->0:03:49.810000
 Oh nice.

21
0:03:58.650000-->0:04:05.140000
