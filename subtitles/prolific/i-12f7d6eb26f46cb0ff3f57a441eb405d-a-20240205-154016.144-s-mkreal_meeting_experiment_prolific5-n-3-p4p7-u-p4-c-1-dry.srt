0:00:10.800000-->0:00:26.700000
 I think the first video call is actually working properly. The first one had delay and he couldn't

1
0:00:26.700000-->0:00:32.360000
 hear me quite well. And then the last one, he was really, really paying down, really

2
0:00:32.360000-->0:00:44.470000
 couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time. As I said, yeah. So, yeah. Whereabouts

3
0:00:44.470000-->0:01:04.320000
 are you? Are you in London now? I'm in North Wales. You do? Did you say? Yeah. Yeah, we're

4
0:01:04.320000-->0:01:12.080000
 nowhere near Snowdonia. We're basically on the English border, you know, Chester. We're basically

5
0:01:12.080000-->0:01:21.100000
 about five miles or so from there. So, just over the border really. Originally from South Africa.

6
0:01:21.100000-->0:01:35.810000
 So, yeah. And we moved over December 2008. So, yeah, it's been a while. I don't know where the years have gone.

7
0:01:35.810000-->0:01:48.910000
 Literally just flown by. Johannesburg, you know? Yeah. You're right.

8
0:01:57.500000-->0:02:08.480000
 Right. What sort of month did you go in? Was it hot? Yeah, it would be hot then.

9
0:02:08.620000-->0:02:20.330000
 Yeah. Well, my parents went to visit my brother and his family. They're in a place called Somerset

10
0:02:20.330000-->0:02:30.340000
 West, which is, I think they said an hour or so from Cape Town. I don't know. I can't remember.

11
0:02:30.760000-->0:02:39.160000
 And it was hot. Because the thing is, we're native and Cape Town, there's a difference in

12
0:02:39.160000-->0:02:45.700000
 temperatures. But they were just like, I was like, you're not going to stay there, are you?

13
0:02:45.700000-->0:02:54.140000
 My mum's like, no. You know, it's 30 in the morning. It's wetter. So, oh, yeah.

14
0:02:56.450000-->0:03:14.060000
 Yeah. Yeah. Did you climb Table Mountain? Yeah. Did you climb Table Mountain?

15
0:03:18.250000-->0:03:28.560000
 Yeah. I haven't done that since we were young, I don't think. Yeah. The thing is,

16
0:03:29.500000-->0:03:37.800000
 it's really hard. Because it's hot. It's really hard to hike and things. They went on a walk

17
0:03:37.800000-->0:03:42.940000
 to some gorge or something. They never got there because they were walking for like two hours.

18
0:03:42.940000-->0:03:50.340000
 And because there's been fires like, I don't know, earlier last year. And

19
0:03:50.860000-->0:03:59.480000
 literally no trees to shelter under. So, anyway, we've got a few seconds left.
