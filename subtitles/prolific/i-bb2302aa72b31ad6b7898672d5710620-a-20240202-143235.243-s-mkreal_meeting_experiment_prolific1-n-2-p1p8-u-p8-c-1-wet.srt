22
0:02:19.630000-->0:02:27.650000
 I've been located recently. So yeah, the whole place is still kind of strange to me and all that

0:02:27.650000-->0:02:31.430000
 So I'm still trying to adapt to the environment and all

0:02:53.270000-->0:02:56.590000
 Well because my husband stays here and

28
0:02:56.590000-->0:03:03.590000
 It wouldn't be nice if I stay back in Nigeria and he's dead. So I had to join him over here. Oh
