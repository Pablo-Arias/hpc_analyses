 So, you're based in Tokyo?

11
0:01:10.050000-->0:01:11.940000
 I'm Femi from Nigeria.

0:01:16.950000-->0:01:19.930000
 Yeah, I'm studying in the UK.

13
0:01:20.950000-->0:01:22.190000
 But I'm from Nigeria.

14
0:01:35.630000-->0:01:35.710000
 Yeah, I'm a student.

15
0:01:35.710000-->0:01:38.330000
 Yeah, just for studies.

16
0:01:48.930000-->0:01:48.990000
 How about you?

17
0:01:49.650000-->0:01:52.110000
 I haven't spent up to a year yet.

18
0:01:58.900000-->0:02:06.500000
 My program is actually a one year program. So, I'm actually in, I'll soon be done though. I'm studying web development.

19
0:02:10.900000-->0:02:14.280000
 So, you're studying web development at the University of Roehampton.

20
0:02:45.940000-->0:02:46.080000
 So, what do you do for fun?

21
0:02:46.080000-->0:02:48
 Oh, you love clubbing, right?

22
0:03:12.480000-->0:03:12.500000
 Yeah.

23
0:03:12.500000-->0:03:16.100000
 Do you play any sport?

24
0:03:22.450000-->0:03:23.630000
 Okay, you woke up.

25
0:03:29.550000-->0:03:32.670000
 Yeah, I play a bit of basketball.

26
0:03:34.550000-->0:03:38.030000
 Then I also work out once in a while.

27
0:03:38.550000-->0:03:42.790000
 It's been a long time I actually went to the gym.

28
0:03:42.790000-->0:03:46.690000
 So, I've been busy, like too busy.

29
0:03:46.690000-->0:03:51.910000
 So, I haven't really, it's choking.

30
0:03:55.550000-->0:04:00.070000
 So, what do you do when you get home from work?

31
0:04:02.550000-->0:04:06.290000
 No, not at all. I'll be fine by you.

32
0:04:06.550000-->0:04:08.270000
 Thank you.
