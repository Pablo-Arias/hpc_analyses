 Hello. Yes, I can hear you fine. Can you hear me? Okay.

1
0:00:24.900000-->0:00:49.050000
 My name is Faith. Hi Martha. Where are you? I'm in Manchester. Yeah, I'm in

2
0:00:49.050000-->0:01:03.150000
 Manchester Northwest. Cool. Oh, I'm a student. I'm a student at University of

3
0:01:03.150000-->0:01:23.380000
 Manchester. What about you? Ah, computing. I'm dying. Yes, computer science. I'm

4
0:01:23.380000-->0:01:30.690000
 dying from the workload. I have no idea yet, but I will figure it out. Something

5
0:01:30.690000-->0:01:35.250000
 definitely in... I don't even know what I want to do with my life, I swear.

6
0:01:35.390000-->0:02:03.010000
 I'm trying to figure it out little by little. What about you? Wow, cool. You try.

7
0:02:03.010000-->0:02:11.700000
 I don't think I can deal with all that. I hate math normally. I don't even know

8
0:02:11.700000-->0:02:23.670000
 how I'm good at coding, but I do not like math. I don't know. I'm very good at

9
0:02:23.670000-->0:02:31.010000
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I know those, but when they put like fractions in front of

10
0:02:31.010000-->0:02:46.610000
 me, I'm like, no, don't, please, no, thank you. You can call it number. Yes, I work

11
0:02:46.610000-->0:02:52.550000
 with numbers, but the computer kind of does that. All I do is nudge it to do

12
0:02:52.550000-->0:02:57.110000
 what I'm telling it to do. So it's pretty simple, especially since they are like

13
0:02:57.110000-->0:03:04.190000
 cheat codes. You can type on chat GPT to help me, or a copilot to help me code

14
0:03:04.190000-->0:03:08.430000
 what I'm trying to code. It's pretty simple. It's not hard at all. Once you

15
0:03:08.430000-->0:03:15.970000
 have the basics down pat, you can do it. I was working for a tech company. I

16
0:03:15.970000-->0:03:23.470000
 started my program here at Manchester. It was pretty simple at the beginning, but

17
0:03:23.470000-->0:03:30.030000
 it's like lots of research, lots of work. I don't like research. I just like put

18
0:03:30.030000-->0:03:34.710000
 more work on me and I'm like, please let me just be in my computer room typing,

19
0:03:34.710000-->0:03:53.430000
 you know. So yeah, I thought it would be. Yeah, yes. Yeah. Yes. But then when you're

20
0:03:53.430000-->0:03:59.350000
 here at school, it seems, oh, our conversation is about to end. When you're

21
0:03:59.350000-->0:04:04.370000
 at school, it seems like you don't really know what you're doing because

22
0:04:04.370000-->0:04:09.370000
 they are telling you so many things, so many information. So right now it feels

23
0:04:09.370000-->0:04:09.870000
 like I don't know.
