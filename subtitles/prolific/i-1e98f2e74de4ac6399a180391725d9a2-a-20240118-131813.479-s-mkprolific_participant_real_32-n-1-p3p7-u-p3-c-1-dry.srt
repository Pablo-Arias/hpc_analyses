0:00:09-->0:00:15.270000
 Hello. Hi, how are you?

1
0:00:18.200000-->0:00:20.900000
 I'm fine. How's your day going?

2
0:00:20.900000-->0:00:30.610000
 Alright. Alright, that's fine. Sorry.

3
0:00:30.750000-->0:00:32.990000
 My name is Zaya. What's your name?

4
0:00:37.630000-->0:00:41.610000
 Oh, Zaya. Nice to meet you. I have a cousin named Zoe.

5
0:00:41.750000-->0:00:51.250000
 Yeah. Yes. I'm in the UK right now.

6
0:00:55.290000-->0:00:56.290000
 Oh, I'm in Princeton.

7
0:00:56.290000-->0:01:04.590000
 Oh, that's cool. That's good to know.

8
0:01:06.580000-->0:01:13.090000
 Yeah. Oh, yeah. Privacy. Yeah.

9
0:01:15.050000-->0:01:18.810000
 Yeah, it is. So cool.

10
0:01:18.810000-->0:01:25.780000
 So, yeah. What kind of dog do you have?

11
0:01:30.230000-->0:01:31.410000
 Oh, okay.

12
0:01:31.450000-->0:01:35.770000
 Oh, Labrador Retrievers. They're really cute. I like that.

13
0:01:35.770000-->0:01:40.370000
 I don't have a dog though, but I'm a little bit scared of them, like touching them.

14
0:01:44.350000-->0:01:46.180000
 Yeah, a little bit.

15
0:01:46.900000-->0:01:50.160000
 But I like them, but I just, I don't know.

16
0:01:50.160000-->0:01:54.900000
 I think when I was little, I had like a dog.

17
0:01:54.900000-->0:01:58.580000
 It beats me. So since then, I've just been a little bit scared.

18
0:02:00.660000-->0:02:00.920000
 Yeah.

19
0:02:06.350000-->0:02:08.950000
 I'm hoping to meet one soon.

20
0:02:09.050000-->0:02:14.010000
 I actually would like to own a dog, but since I can't really touch them, there's no point.

21
0:02:19.620000-->0:02:20
 Yeah.

22
0:02:20-->0:02:21.100000
 Yes.

23
0:02:21.100000-->0:02:22.220000
 Okay.

24
0:02:22.220000-->0:02:28.060000
 So, I think a Chihuahua.

25
0:02:28.060000-->0:02:32.570000
 Yeah, a little.

26
0:02:32.570000-->0:02:36.610000
 Yeah, so I could just be following you everywhere, all about the house, everywhere.

27
0:02:42.010000-->0:02:43.030000
 Yeah, I've heard so.

28
0:02:43.030000-->0:02:45.190000
 They do a lot for you. They take care of you.

29
0:02:45.190000-->0:02:48.050000
 They can be emotionally compatible with you.

30
0:02:48.050000-->0:02:50.730000
 They know how to cheer you up in little ways.

31
0:02:51.660000-->0:02:51.880000
 Yeah.

32
0:02:51.880000-->0:02:54.830000
 I think it would be nice.

33
0:02:58.140000-->0:02:58.420000
 No.

34
0:03:00.580000-->0:03:00.840000
 Yeah.

35
0:03:00.840000-->0:03:04.140000
 But I used to have a tortoise, though, when I was much younger.

36
0:03:04.300000-->0:03:06.040000
 There's a tortoise.

37
0:03:07.640000-->0:03:08.100000
 Yeah.

38
0:03:08.300000-->0:03:13.510000
 Well, it did too.

39
0:03:13.510000-->0:03:15.190000
 But I don't know what happened to him.

40
0:03:15.190000-->0:03:18.390000
 One day, he just, that was it.

41
0:03:18.390000-->0:03:20.050000
 He just wasn't living anymore.

42
0:03:27.410000-->0:03:28.890000
 No, they are really slow.

43
0:03:28.890000-->0:03:30.590000
 They take their time.

44
0:03:30.590000-->0:03:32.110000
 And he was kind of big.

45
0:03:32.110000-->0:03:35.870000
 So, yeah, I think he was just like slowly crawling in.

46
0:03:35.870000-->0:03:36.590000
 All that.

47
0:03:37.330000-->0:03:38.250000
 But he owns space.

48
0:03:38.250000-->0:03:40.330000
 So, it's just crawl around.

49
0:03:40.330000-->0:03:41.190000
 It's space.

50
0:03:41.190000-->0:03:43.170000
 And when he's tired, he should just sit down.

51
0:03:43.170000-->0:03:45.570000
 He should never sit down, but he should just stay one place.

52
0:03:46.750000-->0:03:47.910000
 Just stay at a place.

53
0:03:53.700000-->0:03:55.020000
 I think his name was Allen.

54
0:03:57.590000-->0:03:58.870000
 I didn't really name it.

55
0:03:58.870000-->0:03:59.990000
 Yes, I didn't really name him.

56
0:03:59.990000-->0:04:03.150000
 But I think I used to call him Allen once in a while, but I didn't name it.

57
0:04:09.260000-->0:04:09.560000
 Yeah.
