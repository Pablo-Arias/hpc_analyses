0:00:03.450000-->0:00:21.030000
 Hello. Can you hear me okay? Oh good. Yeah, that's the last lady I spoke to. It was awful.

1
0:00:21.030000-->0:00:26.070000
 It was just crackling all the time. I don't think she even knew I was there. It was very

2
0:00:26.450000-->0:00:41.730000
 difficult. Oh dear. Are you a student? What are you studying? Ah. I just guessed.

3
0:00:44.600000-->0:01:04.840000
 What do you want to do? Ah. Yeah. Oh right. Yeah. Would you go on to do the next one?

4
0:01:04.840000-->0:01:43.880000
 Is it a doctorate or something? Oh. Why? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny because my son,

5
0:01:43.880000-->0:01:50.080000
 my son's like, he's done his really much later in life. He's like 40, in his late 30s when

6
0:01:50.080000-->0:01:55.240000
 he did his and he was going to go on to do that but then he said it's just too much work.

7
0:01:55.240000-->0:01:59.960000
 You know, all those years he's done the studying and then to add another three or whatever

8
0:01:59.960000-->0:02:04.600000
 on is, it's just too much. You know, it interferes with your home life too much, doesn't it?

9
0:02:17.250000-->0:02:29.710000
 Really? Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. Cool. I'm retired. I took retirement last year.

10
0:02:29.710000-->0:02:38.660000
 So, yeah. Yeah. I love it. I mean, to be honest, it's nice. You know, I mean, you can do what

11
0:02:38.660000-->0:02:43.980000
 you want when you want, eat what you want when you want. And like holidays, it doesn't

12
0:02:43.980000-->0:02:47.980000
 restrict you. Like we like travelling, my husband and I, and you know, we've never been

13
0:02:47.980000-->0:02:53.760000
 able to holiday in the winter. And next month we're doing like a winter holiday. We're going

14
0:02:53.760000-->0:02:59.800000
 to Norway and we're going reindeer sledging and husky sledging and we're going to see

15
0:02:59.800000-->0:03:03.760000
 the Northern Lights and we're going to the Ice Hotel, you know, all things we couldn't

16
0:03:03.760000-->0:03:15.080000
 do. So, we're sort of ticking off a bucket list now. And yeah. Well, we've travelled

17
0:03:15.080000-->0:03:23.280000
 a lot. I mean, I don't know really, but that's the main place, you know, on the list. I'd

18
0:03:23.280000-->0:03:34.290000
 like to go to Japan maybe one day, but yeah. I've been to the Far East. Yeah. Thailand,

19
0:03:34.290000-->0:03:42.550000
 Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong. Yeah. That was lovely. It was an experience. Go if you

20
0:03:42.550000-->0:04:08.990000
 get the chance. Yeah. Do you plan on travelling? Oh no. Yeah. Yeah, I do. But it's going to

21
0:04:08.990000-->0:04:09.770000
 finish in 15 days.
