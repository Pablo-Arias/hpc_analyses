 Hello, I'm good thank you, how are you? What's your name? Oh, whereabouts are you?

1
0:00:25.250000-->0:00:39.660000
 I'm in East Anglia. Oh fantastic, yes, I'm in Suffolk, yes, oh lovely, lovely.

2
0:00:39.660000-->0:00:56.880000
 Oh, what made you move? Oh sorry, oh perfect, oh do you know what, so we moved here a couple

3
0:00:56.880000-->0:01:03.700000
 of years ago to originally from Gloucestershire, so other side, very wet and then decided,

4
0:01:03.700000-->0:01:08.900000
 you know, pandemic, we wanted to be closer to family, so moved over and it's lovely,

5
0:01:08.900000-->0:01:15.260000
 really like it here, completely different, but yeah, really nice. What about where you are now?

6
0:01:22.720000-->0:01:24.320000
 Oh, Cheshire's beautiful.

7
0:01:44.550000-->0:01:50.040000
 Always prepared. Oh, do you get out a lot in the Peak District then?

8
0:02:12.150000-->0:02:17.550000
 Oh, I think that's it, I think that's it and you know, it's really hard I think at the moment

9
0:02:17.550000-->0:02:23.130000
 because obviously going through something personally and for yourself and then it must

10
0:02:23.130000-->0:02:27.670000
 be quite challenging, you know, turning on the news and there's very rarely any good news at

11
0:02:27.670000-->0:02:31.810000
 the minute these days, isn't there, in the world, so if you just let that kind of negativity

12
0:02:31.810000-->0:02:37.090000
 overwhelm you then it's going to get you down, isn't it, so that's a good way to think.

13
0:03:12.390000-->0:03:16.750000
 Crikey, because I was going to say, I think her recovery period has been estimated something

14
0:03:16.750000-->0:03:20.310000
 quite significant, hasn't it, so you've obviously gone through some kind of major,

15
0:03:20.310000-->0:03:24.150000
 major surgery yourself and that must have been really challenging. Have you ever had

16
0:03:24.150000-->0:03:48.700000
 surgery before or has this been your first time? Oh my goodness. And are you being supported by,

17
0:03:48.700000-->0:04:04.010000
 you know, physiotherapists in the hospital? Oh yeah, that's flying by,

18
0:04:04.010000-->0:04:09.830000
 and I wish you all the best for your recovery, just take it easy, won't you?
