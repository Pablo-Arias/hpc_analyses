 Hi there. I'm okay, thank you. How are you? Good. Yes. Do you prefer Yasmina or Jasmine,

1
0:00:24.380000-->0:00:43.130000
 which yes. Oh, it's a beautiful name. My name's Leah. I think I'm Leah. That's right. Yes.

2
0:00:43.130000-->0:00:52.050000
 I get a lot of people calling me Leah and Lee, but nothing like Yasmina. So whereabouts are you,

3
0:00:52.050000-->0:01:03.380000
 Yasmina? So I'm in Suffolk, so just up north from you. Yeah. So it's beautiful, sunny here,

4
0:01:03.380000-->0:01:08.060000
 quite cold obviously, but yeah, it's really nice. Do you like living in London?

5
0:01:08.060000-->0:01:47.870000
 Mm-hmm. Oh, really? Oh, that's brilliant to hear actually. Because I think as a country,

6
0:01:47.870000-->0:01:51.870000
 we're quite hard on ourselves, we're quite negative. And so we always hear kind of like,

7
0:01:51.870000-->0:01:55.230000
 oh, it's not good enough. But that's actually really good to hear actually, that you can get

8
0:01:55.230000-->0:02:24.240000
 around. Wow. That's fantastic. That's fantastic. So apart from the weather, do you think there's

9
0:02:24.240000-->0:02:34.430000
 any other things that you miss? Where did you move from in 2016? Macedonia. I'm really sorry.

10
0:02:35.430000-->0:02:40.790000
 The only things I know about Macedonia, you take part in the Eurovision Song Contest,

11
0:02:40.870000-->0:02:45.770000
 which is really bad, isn't it? It's really bad. I should broaden my horizons. I'm sorry.

12
0:02:54.200000-->0:03:20.450000
 Tiny. Wow. Okay. And yes, yes. Hence why it's so cold here. That's okay. This is making sense now.

13
0:03:20.830000-->0:03:38.010000
 Okay. Oh, and what made you move over here? Oh, fantastic. Wow. What did you study? Oh, wow.

14
0:03:38.570000-->0:03:58.650000
 Oh, amazing. Oh, that's fantastic. I'm so pleased.

0:04:03.050000-->0:04:09.810000
